# Questions/blog post ideas

* How are utility companies incentivized/disincentivized re energy use reductions?
* Pros/cons: nuclear power
* How much would oil have to cost for X alternative biofuel to make sense - esp waste products like polystyrene, coffee grounds, human fat etc
* How to create sustainable reasonably priced alternative to personal car ownership for disabled? Electric Uber with self driving much cheaper?
* What industries use diesel/wouldn't need retrofit to switch to biofuel?
* Consumption of diesel vs production of biofuel over time
* How exactly does the carbon cycle work and how can we manipulate it
* What is the carbon "exchange rate" of not driving cars vs. planting trees vs. etc.? Planting 8777 trees = taking 9.33 cars off the road = 111940 roads removed [Lovins, 71][Lovins]
* What $ savings/investments can be made for various energy efficiency improvements?
* How does ethanol vs. oil-based fuel work?
* Original car inventors envisioned ethanol as the primary fuel for the vehicle. Why did we make the switch? - higher energy density in oil, but there is probably an interesting geopolitical/free markets story to tell here
* Blockadia phrased as a war, with death/injury counts of protestors and police (and secondary/tertiary impacts from projects that go through)
* SequoiaView for utilities usage - ability to drill down to see who is using how much of what in a community/city/etc
* How to eat to minimize carbon footprint - partially resolved, see [Berners-Lee][Berners-Lee] and [my post on it](https://blog.hc3.io/book-report-how-bad-are-bananas-the-carbon-footprint-of-everything-d254377af813#.c97uah753)
* How power is lost in the grid system and ideas to combat this
* Create accurate public perception surrounding the social and planetary costs of nuclear energy. Waste disposal and other issues are not all worked out, ethically – but where do these impacts stand in relation to coal and oil in terms of human and environmental degradation per watt?
