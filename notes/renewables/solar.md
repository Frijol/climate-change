# Solar

* Electric demand of the U.S. could be met by covering 9% of Nevada with PV according to DoE report [Lovins, 72][Lovins]
* Solar thermal: heat water from the sun. 1 in 10 houses in China, not so many in the States [Lovins, 66][Lovins]
* "This is a ~16% learning rate, meaning that every doubling of utility-scale solar capacity in the US leads to a roughly 16% reduction in the cost of electricity from new solar installations." [Naam][NaamSolar]
* "If current rates of improvement hold, solar will be incredibly cheap by the time it’s a substantial fraction of the world’s electricity supply." ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Future-Solar-Cost-Projections-PPA-LCOE.jpg) [Naam][NaamSolar]
* At the scale of utility installations, the cost of solar modules are now less than half of the price of delpoying solar. Inverters, labor, grid connection, and other soft costs are now higher. [Naam][NaamSolar]
