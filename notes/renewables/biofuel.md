# Biofuel

* Biochar: as plants grow, they pull CO2 out of the air, but they release it again when they decay. Instead of letting it decay, heat woody material at low temperature anaerobically until it is carbonized (pyrolysis). Use this material as a fertilizer - dug into the ground, carbon is sequestered. Byproduct is biodiesel. [Lovins, 199-200][Lovins]
* Biodiesel: can be made out of many things - not just waste oil and food but also "trash" such as dirty diapers and styrofoam cups. Typically, these types of solutions create cellulosic ethanol [Lovins, 162-163][Lovins]
* Brazil weaned themselves off of global oil dependency via the National Alcohol Program (1975). Required oil company to blend at least 22% ethanol (made from local sugarcane) into its fuel, while offering low-interest loans. [Lovins, 160][Lovins]
* Issues with upstream emissions (e.g. deforestation for plantation of fuel-source plants) crimp spread of biofuel as savior [Lovins, 161][Lovins]
* Ethanol is not an efficient energy source. The energy content of ethanol is 65% that of gasoline [Smil, 98][Smil]
* Corn-based ethanol requires more land than we can use. If all of America’s gasoline were from corn derived ethanol, the growing of corn to cover American fuel use would require 220mil hectares, 20% more than American arable land [Smil, 101][Smil]
* Ethanol-providing crops can contribute to environmental degradation. In corn crops, nitrogen fertilizer runoff is a key negative effect (p103). In other crops, such as sugar cane, expanding need for arable land can contribute to deforestation [Smil, 101][Smil]
* Sugar cane is better than corn for ethanol production because it requires minimal fertilizer and has a higher power yield per hectare of planting [Smil, 104][Smil]
* The United States has high tariffs on Brazilian sugar cane ethanol, so it is not commonly imported into the United States [Smil, 105][Smil]
* Cellulosic ethanol is a promising technology to turn waste into biofuel, but it is yet unproven as commercially viable. Though it will take decades to scale up this industry, it is worthwhile to research potential processes for creating cellulosic ethanol [Smil, 108][Smil].
* Since energy density is lower in biofuel than in gas (and we have inefficient vehicles) miles per gallon would be low and fuel weight could be significant in a biofueled car [Smil, 114][Smil]
* There is [government support for cellulosic ethanol plant development in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulosic_ethanol_commercialization#Government_support)
