# Biofuel

* Biochar: as plants grow, they pull CO2 out of the air, but they release it again when they decay. Instead of letting it decay, heat woody material at low temperature anaerobically until it is carbonized (pyrolysis). Use this material as a fertilizer - dug into the ground, carbon is sequestered. Byproduct is biodiesel. [Lovins, 199-200][Lovins]
* Biodiesel: can be made out of many things - not just waste oil and food but also "trash" such as dirty diapers and styrofoam cups. Typically, these types of solutions create cellulosic ethanol [Lovins, 162-163][Lovins]
* Brazil weaned themselves off of global oil dependency via the National Alcohol Program (1975). Required oil company to blend at least 22% ethanol (made from local sugarcane) into its fuel, while offering low-interest loans. [Lovins, 160][Lovins]
* Issues with upstream emissions (e.g. deforestation for plantation of fuel-source plants) crimp spread of biofuel as savior [Lovins, 161][Lovins]
