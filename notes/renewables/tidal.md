# Tidal Power

## How it works
* Major methods are tidal barrage (essentially a hydroelectric dam: open for inflow, close & run generator on outflow), tidal stream generator (underwater turbine), and dynamic tidal power (not defined but perhaps similar to wave mechanisms?) [Maehlum]
* Peak-to-trough amplitude of tides would be theoretically ~1m due to solar + lunar gravity on a perfectly fluid Earth. We see more extreme tides (e.g. 4m in Puget Sound) where there are geographical restrictions or shallower water. In an *inlet*, water has to *flow* in & out to accommodate the tide change [Murphy-tides]
* Tidal barrage power calculations: P=ρFgh, where ρ = 1000 kg/m³,  g = 10 m/s² (surface gravity), F is the flow rate of water in (m³/s), and h is the height of the water behind the dam. **h** is very small in a tidal installation compared with river hydroelectric (often 200m+). Accounting for timing (outer water has to be higher to create inflow, so you can't harvest the whole tide), ideal power is P = (1/8)πρgAH²/T, where A is the area impounded, H is the peak-to-peak tidal amplitude, and T is the period (about 12 hours) [Murphy-tides]


## Feasibility
* Alaska has 90% of the United States' potential for tidal power [Palomino]

* Energy is expensive in rural Alaska regardless of its source, so new technologies like tidal turbines might be close to economic parity with imported energy sources (e.g. diesel) [Palomino]
* Cook Inlet near Anchorage is the second biggest source of tidal power in the United States. The city currently depends on nearby natural gas reserves, but the inlet has enough power to supply the city. Ocean Renewable Power Company is currently investigating connecting tidal generators from Cook Inlet to the Railbelt (80% of power supply in Alaska) [Palomino]

## Existing installations
* Rance installation in France: built 1966, peak capacity of 240 MW, impounds 22.5 km² on an average tidal amplitude of 8 m. Typical generation of 96 MW [Murphy-tides]
* Sihwa in South Korea: 254 MW of peak capacity, 30 km² of impound [Murphy-tides]
