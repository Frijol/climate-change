# Tidal Power
* Alaska has 90% of the United States' potential for tidal power [Palomino]

* Energy is expensive in rural Alaska regardless of its source, so new technologies like tidal turbines might be close to economic parity with imported energy sources (e.g. diesel) [Palomino]
* Cook Inlet near Anchorage is the second biggest source of tidal power in the United States. The city currently depends on nearby natural gas reserves, but the inlet has enough power to supply the city. Ocean Renewable Power Company is currently investigating connecting tidal generators from Cook Inlet to the Railbelt (80% of power supply in Alaska) [Palomino]
