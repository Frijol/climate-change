# Renewable energy
* Hoped-for breakthrough technologies: fusion reactors, nanoscale solar cells [Victor]
* "clean coal": idea whereby coal-fired plants capture CO2 before it leaves the smokestack and bury it (sequester) in the earth. Mechanism: pressurized CO2 injected into saline aquifers below impermeable caprock - 1k-8k feet deep. There, it would form mild carbonic acid, which would dissolve and precipitate out as dolomite and limestone [Weisman, 223][Weisman]
* Learn more about municipal solid waste (MSW) for energy generation [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste#Energy_generation) qualifies for RPS in some states [EIA, 38][EIA]
