# Renewable energy
* Hoped-for breakthrough technologies: fusion reactors, nanoscale solar cells [Victor]
* "clean coal": idea whereby coal-fired plants capture CO2 before it leaves the smokestack and bury it (sequester) in the earth. Mechanism: pressurized CO2 injected into saline aquifers below impermeable caprock - 1k-8k feet deep. There, it would form mild carbonic acid, which would dissolve and precipitate out as dolomite and limestone [Weisman, 223][Weisman]
* Colocation of wind & solar might make sense for renewables because they have ~opposite peaks. It also lets both farms use the same infrastructure [Cuff]
* Colocation of wind and solar in practice [Pattison]: ![https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/54690/3_Pattison_etal.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y](http://i.imgur.com/iCQ3M4l.png)

## Geothermal
* Geothermal: requires hot rock and water (so e.g. island volcanic areas). Porous rock sponges up rainfall, volcano heats this. Dig a hole to create a vent, then hook up a turbine to get power. Iceland uses geothermal for 25% of its electricity and 90% of its heating/hot water needs [Lovins, 75][Lovins]
* One nuclear power plant produces 1gW. Geothermal across the states produces 2gW [Lovins]

## Wave
* Wave power by Pelamis: semi-submerged articulated structure undulates, pushing hydraulic rams, which pump fluids through hydraulic motors to generate electricity [Lovins, 77][Lovins]
* Wave + hydroelectric power by Aquamarine Power's Oyster: a hinged flap connected to the seabed 30m down moves with the waves. This drives a hydraulic piston, which shoots high-pressure water to an onshore turbine [Lovins, 78][Lovins]

## Tidal
* Alaska has 90% of the United States' potential for tidal power [Palomino]

* Energy is expensive in rural Alaska regardless of its source, so new technologies like tidal turbines might be close to economic parity with imported energy sources (e.g. diesel) [Palomino]
* Cook Inlet near Anchorage is the second biggest source of tidal power in the United States. The city currently depends on nearby natural gas reserves, but the inlet has enough power to supply the city. Ocean Renewable Power Company is currently investigating connecting tidal generators from Cook Inlet to the Railbelt (80% of power supply in Alaska) [Palomino]

## Infrastructure
* Current American grids: Texas (ERCOT), East, and West. They are separately managed. [Chabot]
* Current grid systems are highly distributed. Power transmission lines are expensive and inefficient - local solar & wind reduces cost and energy production need [Lovins, 72][Lovins]
* The current power grid is not set up to support distributed power; it works through a few sources providing great amounts of energy. [Victor]
* The United States has very few HVDC lines. "The cost of high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines is roughly 1 cents per kwh for 500 miles, or 1.5 cents per kwh for 1,000 miles transmitted. Over 1,000 miles, an HVDC line may lose 5% or so of the electricity it transmits." [Naam][NaamWind]
