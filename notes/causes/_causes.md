# Causes of climate change

## Stub notes
* Methane emissions from thawing peat bogs in Western Siberia are up to 100k tons/day, a greater warming effect than U.S. man-made emissions [Pearce, 79][Pearce]
* Stordalen mire: well-monitored permafrost peat bog in northern Sweden that is beginning to break up [Pearce, 82][Pearce]
* 1-10t tons of methane is currently held by clathrates [Pearce, 92][Pearce]
* Per-capita human impact: average resource consumption and waste production of one person. A society's total impact is per-capita impact multiplied by population. [Diamond, 353][Diamond]
* The world's highest-emission companies: [Carbon Majors, 2017](https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499866813)
* The transport sector is responsible for 23% of global emissions [Hawken, 136][Hawken]
* Waste production grew tenfold in the last century and is expected to double again by 2025 (2017 stat) [Hawken, 158][Hawken]
* At least half of waste is generated outside households (industrial) [Hawken, 160][Hawken]
* 5-6% of the world's annual oil production is feedstock for plastic manufacturing [Hawken, 168][Hawken]
* 1/3 of plastic ends up in ecosystems, 5% is recycled; the rest is landfilled or burned [Hawken, 169][Hawken]
* Hot water is responsible for a quarter of residential energy use globally [Hawken, 170][Hawken]
