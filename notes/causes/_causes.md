# Causes of climate change

| Greenhouse gas | Global Warming Potential (GWP) | Remains in atmosphere | Emitted from |
|---|---|---|---|
| Carbon dioxide (CO2) | 1 (by definition of GWP) [EPA-GWP] | 20-200 years to remove 65-80%, then hundreds of thousands of years [Clark] | Fossil fuel combustion (coal, natural gas, oil), solid waste combustion, cement manufacturing [EPA] |
| Methane (CH4) | 28-36 [EPA-GWP] | 12 years [Clark] | Natural gas combustion, production and transportation of coal, natural gas, and oil, livestock agriculture (cows, mostly), anaerobic decomposition of organic waste e.g. in landfills [EPA] |
| Nitrous oxide | 265-298 [EPA-GWP] | 114 years [Clark] | Agricultural and industrial activities, combustion of fossil fuels and solid waste [EPA] |
| Halocarbons/CFCs | 1000s-10,000s [EPA-GWP] | Varies from less than a year to thousands of years. [Here is a table.](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch2s2-10-2.html#table-2-14) | Freon (refrigerators), industrial processes [EPA] |

* **The amount of carbon that can be burned between 2011 and 2049 to have a 50% chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees celcius is 565 gigatons. Reserves already claimed by all fossil fuel companies for oil, gas, and coal amounts to 2,795 gigatons of carbon.** [Klein, 134][Klein]

## Stub notes
* Methane emissions from thawing peat bogs in Western Siberia are up to 100k tons/day, a greater warming effect than U.S. man-made emissions [Pearce, 79][Pearce]
* Stordalen mire: well-monitored permafrost peat bog in northern Sweden that is beginning to break up [Pearce, 82][Pearce]
* 1-10t tons of methane is currently held by clathrates [Pearce, 92][Pearce]
* Per-capita human impact: average resource consumption and waste production of one person. A society's total impact is per-capita impact multiplied by population. [Diamond, 353][Diamond]
* The world's highest-emission companies: [Carbon Majors, 2017](https://b8f65cb373b1b7b15feb-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/002/327/original/Carbon-Majors-Report-2017.pdf?1499866813)
* The transport sector is responsible for 23% of global emissions [Hawken, 136][Hawken]
* Waste production grew tenfold in the last century and is expected to double again by 2025 (2017 stat) [Hawken, 158][Hawken]
* At least half of waste is generated outside households (industrial) [Hawken, 160][Hawken]
* 5-6% of the world's annual oil production is feedstock for plastic manufacturing [Hawken, 168][Hawken]
* 1/3 of plastic ends up in ecosystems, 5% is recycled; the rest is landfilled or burned [Hawken, 169][Hawken]
* Hot water is responsible for a quarter of residential energy use globally [Hawken, 170][Hawken]
