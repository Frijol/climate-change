* Natural gas has been going through huge boom in the United States [EIA, 83][EIA]
* Rising natural gas

## Climate change problems caused by natural gas
* The vast majority of new gas projects in North America rely on fracking [Klein, 192][Klein]
* Natural gas has been argued for as a "clean alternative" to oil, but fracked natural gas may emit enough methane to make it comparable in "dirtiness" to coal [Klein, 192][Klein]
* Methane has a warming potential 86 times greater than carbon dioxide [Klein, 130][Klein]
* Modern fracking takes 70-300x the amount of fluid (usually water + sand) used in traditional fracking. This fluid often becomes toxic, radioactive waste. 280 billions of this waste were created from fracking in 2012. [Klein, 312][Klein]
