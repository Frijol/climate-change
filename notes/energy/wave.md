# Wave
* Wave power by Pelamis: semi-submerged articulated structure undulates, pushing hydraulic rams, which pump fluids through hydraulic motors to generate electricity [Lovins, 77][Lovins]
* Wave + hydroelectric power by Aquamarine Power's Oyster: a hinged flap connected to the seabed 30m down moves with the waves. This drives a hydraulic piston, which shoots high-pressure water to an onshore turbine [Lovins, 78][Lovins]

## Further reading
* Stephen Salter is world expert on wave power. Here's his comprehensive paper on a lifetime of work in the field: [Wave energy: Nostalgic Ramblings, future hopes and heretical suggestions](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40722-016-0057-3)
