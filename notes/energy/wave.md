# Wave
Power from the waves uses various dynamics of ocean waves to generate energy: the lifting force (heave), swaying and turning, changing underwater pressure, etc. Key challenges are efficiency, longevity/maintenance, and ability to harvest the electricity to the shore.

## Methods of electricity generation
* Airbags push air back and forth through an underwater wind turbine due to the changing underwater pressure as waves roll overhead [Rusch, 17][Rusch]
* A buoy fixed to a sliding magnet assembly rises and falls, sliding up and down on a rod containing stationary generator coils [Rusch, 26][Rusch]
* A buoy lifting up and down moves a lever arm either above the water or sloped below the water [Salter, 400][Salter]
* A hinged flap moves horizontally with the wave; the hinge contains a dynamometer. This motion appears to be more efficient than using the heave to move a buoyant object [Salter, 401][Salter]
* Salter's Duck: built for maximal efficiency in harvesting all of a wave's energy (90% achieved) with a round back to allow for the circular motion of water particles in a wave and a pointed front to allow the water particles to continue their decaying orbitals [Salter, 401][Salter]

## Commercial wave power
* Wave power by Pelamis: semi-submerged articulated structure undulates, pushing hydraulic rams, which pump fluids through hydraulic motors to generate electricity [Lovins, 77][Lovins]
* Wave + hydroelectric power by Aquamarine Power's Oyster: a hinged flap connected to the seabed 30m down moves with the waves. This drives a hydraulic piston, which shoots high-pressure water to an onshore turbine [Lovins, 78][Lovins]
