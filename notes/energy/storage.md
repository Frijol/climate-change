# Energy storage

* Summary of available energy storage mechanisms, from [Pattison]:

|         mechanism        | requirements of system |
| -------------------------|------------------------|
| concentrated solar power | water                  |
| supercapacitors          | voltage control        |
| hydrogen                 | tanks & water          |
| pumped hydroelectrics    | large amount of water  |
| compressed air           | temperature & geography|
| flywheels                | short storage duration |
| batteries                | several..              |

* Energy storage in large Lithium-Ion batteries: ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/How-Cheap-Can-Lithium-Ion-Batteries-Get-Energy-Storage-800x422.jpg) [Naam][NaamStorage]
* Lithium-Ion batteries are in the 10-25c/kwH range (compared with 7c/kwH for natural gas) for the forseeable future, but this is not a whole accounting. Batteries are a load flattener, so we can use any existing & new generators more evenly + reduce need for peaker plants. This graph makes even the 25c/kwH price look plausible: ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CA-Time-of-Use-Pricing-Model-400x134.png) [Naam][NaamStorage]
* Lithium-Ion batteries die out after ~1k cycles & are better to discharge only 70%; Flow can be used for 5-10k cycles, CAES for 10k+ with full discharge [Naam][NaamStorage]
* CAES batteries don't leak the way traditional Lithium-Ion batteries do. CAES batteries can be stored for years [Naam][NaamStorage]
* Battery performance is sub-par and degrades quickly. Lithium ion batteries lose power even when idle and their performance degrades over time and with temperature. Tesla engineers expect the car battery pack to degrade by as much as 30% in 5 years [Smil, 29][Smil]
