*Sources for CO2-Equivalent graph cited through the Emission Factors of Common Fuels table in Wikipedia’s page on Emission intensity. Minimum/maximum variations depend on fuel quality and how the fuel is sourced and processed.*

#### Energy return on energy invested (EROEI)
You have to use some energy to get the energy you need to use. Changing ratios provide a useful look at energy pinch points. Oil was originally ~100:1, now it's closer to 20:1.

| Fuel                      | EROEI   |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Natural gas               | 20-40:1 |
| Oil                       |    20:1 |
| Wind                      |    20:1 |
| Nuclear (new)             |    15:1 |
| Solar                     |    10:1 |
| Sugar cane ethanol        |     8:1 |
| Tar sands                 |     5:1 |
| Shale oil                 |     3:1 |
| Corn ethanol (optimistic) |   1.4:1 |

#### Electricity generation by fuel
* Projected electricity generation by fuel in the United States:

* Norway meets nearly all of its electrical power needs through hydro [Hug, 6][Hug]
* France is a leader in nuclear power, which accounts for about 3/4 of its electrical energy [Hug, 6][Hug]
* Denmark is a leader in wind, which was 19% of its total electric energy demand in 2006 [Hug, 6][Hug]
* Norway & Sweden have strong hydropower resources, which can be time-moderated; Denmark's wind power is more sporadic. Denmark can trade high production from wind farms to Norway and Sweden when it is cheap, and purchase timely hydropower when wind is not meeting demand [Hug, 6][Hug]


## Stubs
* No country, as of 2000, uses local power as a major (even non-negligible) energy source [Smil, 49][Smil]
