# Energy
* energy return on energy invested (EROEI): you have to use some energy to get the energy you need to use. Changing ratios provide a useful look at energy pinch points. Oil was originally ~100:1, now it's closer to 20:1.

| Fuel                      | EROEI   |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Natural gas               | 20-40:1 |
| Oil                       |    20:1 |
| Wind                      |    20:1 |
| Nuclear (new)             |    15:1 |
| Solar                     |    10:1 |
| Sugar cane ethanol        |     8:1 |
| Tar sands                 |     5:1 |
| Shale oil                 |     3:1 |
| Corn ethanol (optimistic) |   1.4:1 |

## Renewable energy (stubs)
* Hoped-for breakthrough technologies: fusion reactors, nanoscale solar cells [Victor]
* Learn more about municipal solid waste (MSW) for energy generation [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste#Energy_generation) qualifies for RPS in some states [EIA, 38][EIA]
* New generation of power 2015-2040 is dominated by renewable and natural gas, regardless of policy. Policy drives the extent to which natural gas dominates. [EIA, 100][EIA]

## Stubs
* No country, as of 2000, uses local power as a major (even non-negligible) energy source [Smil, 49][Smil]
