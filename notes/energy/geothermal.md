# Geothermal

## How does it work?
* Geothermal: requires hot rock and water (so e.g. island volcanic areas). Porous rock sponges up rainfall, volcano or other hot part of earth's crust heats this. Dig a hole to create a vent, then hook up a turbine to get power. Iceland uses geothermal for 25% of its electricity and 90% of its heating/hot water needs [Lovins, 75][Lovins]
* 3 necessary factors for a geothermal site: heat, fluid, and permeability [Chao]
* Conventional geothermal: drill a borehole "injection borehole" for injection, inject the fluid, drill other boreholes "production boreholes" to harvest the steam [Hug, 4][Hug]

## Current Research
* EGS (enhanced geothermal): find an area with high temperature gradient but low permeability and artificially create a fracture network in the rocks (a "geothermal reservoir") [Chao]
* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory + 7 other labs are partnering on a $9 million project to develop enhanced geothermal energy (EGS), particularly improving understanding of underground rock fractures [Chao]

### Who's involved in geothermal research?
* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is leading studies on EGS [Chao]
* DOE's geothermal project: Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) [Chao]
* Stanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) will be the site to study induced fracture networks for use as geothermal reservoirs [Chao]

### Ocean thermal
* OTEC was studied for feasibility by Japan– installations called Mini-OTEC and OTEC 1 were installed in 1979 and 1980, respectively. A 31.5 kW/h installation went into operation in 1981 [Charlier, 13][Charlier]
* Closed-circuit OTEC was installed at Keahole Point in Hawaii in 1993, produced 50 kWh [Charlier, 14][Charlier]
* No full-scale utility OTEC has been built or put into service [Charlier, 14][Charlier]

## Potential Impact
* One nuclear power plant produces 1GW. Geothermal across the States produces 2GW [Lovins]
* In the continental United States, high geothermal gradients exist in the Western states, particularly Nevada [Chao]
* Capacity of the United States for geothermal is 3.5GW. With EGS, it could theoretically be over 100GW [Chao]
