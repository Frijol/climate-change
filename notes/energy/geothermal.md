## Geothermal
* Geothermal: requires hot rock and water (so e.g. island volcanic areas). Porous rock sponges up rainfall, volcano or other hot part of earth's crust heats this. Dig a hole to create a vent, then hook up a turbine to get power. Iceland uses geothermal for 25% of its electricity and 90% of its heating/hot water needs [Lovins, 75][Lovins]
* 3 necessary factors for a geothermal site: heat, fluid, and permeability [Chao]
* Conventional geothermal
* One nuclear power plant produces 1GW. Geothermal across the States produces 2GW [Lovins]
* In the continental United States, high geothermal gradients exist in the Western states, particularly Nevada [Chao]
* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory + 7 other labs are partnering on a $9 million project to develop enhanced geothermal energy (EGS), particularly improving understanding of underground rock fractures [Chao]
* Capacity of the United States for geothermal is 3.5GW. With EGS, it could theoretically be over 100GW [Chao]
* EGS: find an area with high temperature gradient but low permeability and artificially create a fracture network in the rocks (a "geothermal reservoir") [Chao]

### Who's involved in this space?
* Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is leading studies on EGS [Chao]
* DOE's geothermal project: Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) [Chao]
* Stanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) will be the site to study induced fracture networks for use as geothermal reservoirs [Chao]
