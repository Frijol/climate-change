# Solar

## Mechanisms
* Photovoltaic: light converted to electricity
* Solar thermal: heat water from the sun. 1 in 10 houses in China, not so many in the States [Lovins, 66][Lovins]

## Feasibility of large-scale deployment
* Electric demand of the U.S. could be met by covering 9% of Nevada with PV according to DoE report [Lovins, 72][Lovins]
* Solar has installed capacity of 137GWs worldwide as of 2015. The majority is in developed economies. [IFC, 3][IFC]

## Economics
* "This is a ~16% learning rate, meaning that every doubling of utility-scale solar capacity in the US leads to a roughly 16% reduction in the cost of electricity from new solar installations." [Naam][NaamSolar]
* "If current rates of improvement hold, solar will be incredibly cheap by the time it’s a substantial fraction of the world’s electricity supply." ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Future-Solar-Cost-Projections-PPA-LCOE.jpg) [Naam][NaamSolar]
* At the scale of utility installations, the cost of solar modules are now less than half of the price of deploying solar. Inverters, labor, grid connection, and other soft costs are now higher. [Naam][NaamSolar]
* Cost of solar PV power plants has decreased 80% in the 2008-2015 period [IFC, 3][IFC]
* Solar capacity in the United States is expected to rise steadily through 2040 as a result of the declining capital cost of installation and from ITC incentives [EIA, 112][EIA]

## How to
* Detailed 2015 guide to the siting, building, and operation of a solar site available [here][IFC]
* Key components to solar farm design are PV plant design, available solar energy resource, energy yield, and site selection [IFC, 5][IFC]
