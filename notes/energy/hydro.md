# Hydropower

## How does it work?
* Water flow moves a primary mover such as a turbine or water wheel
* Run-of-the-river does not interfere with the flow of water; dammed hydropower involves blocking the water flow to constrict flow points (increasing pressure) and/or to build up hydrostatic head for more convenient timing
* Flow can be moderated with sluice gates

### Turbine types

## Hydro and storage
* One of the oldest forms of energy storage is behind a dam– including using the energy of water flow at times where capacity is higher than demand to pump water back up into a reservoir
