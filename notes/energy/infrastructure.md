# Infrastructure
An excellent introduction to terms and organization of the electric grid can be found in [Caspary].

* FERC is officially voluntary, 1/3 of US transmission is outside of FERC and RTOs (mostly Texas) [Caspary, 7-8][Caspary]
* Transmission systems mostly take place through organized markets (ISOs/RTOs). Other agreements are often called bilateral (2-way agreement between energy supplier and distributor) [Caspary, 13][Caspary]
* Current American grids: Texas (ERCOT), East, and West. They are separately managed. [Chabot]
* Current grid systems are highly distributed. Power transmission lines are expensive and inefficient - local solar & wind reduces cost and energy production need [Lovins, 72][Lovins]
* The current power grid is not set up to support distributed power; it works through a few sources providing great amounts of energy. [Victor]
* The United States has very few HVDC lines. "The cost of high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines is roughly 1 cents per kwh for 500 miles, or 1.5 cents per kwh for 1,000 miles transmitted. Over 1,000 miles, an HVDC line may lose 5% or so of the electricity it transmits." [Naam][NaamWind]

## Transition in major energy sources
* Energy transitions are slow by nature. Oil took 50 years to climb from first commercial production to a 10% market share, and we continue to depend on prior dominant energy forms: coal, wood [Smil, 138][Smil]
* Quick energy transitions destabilize economies. Any new technology adoption requires a heavy up-front investment (estimated by Smil at at least $3 trillion). This is needed both in the energy sourcing and transport infrastructures, and in the “primary movers”, the major users of the new energy (such as cars). Primary movers take years to become efficient [Smil, 138][Smil].
* Quick changes in primary energy sources leaves less time to build infrastructure and primary movers. Transition also requires people who had invested in the old system to write off of that infrastructure investment [Smil, 142][Smil]
* From data up to 2008, we are not currently transitioning off of oil. In 2008, energy from new renewable energy sources was less than 2.4% in the United States. [Smil, 135][Smil]

## Siting: colocation of wind + solar
* Colocation of wind & solar might make sense for renewables because they have ~opposite peaks. It also lets both farms use the same infrastructure [Cuff]
* Colocation of wind and solar in practice [Pattison]: ![https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/54690/3_Pattison_etal.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y](http://i.imgur.com/iCQ3M4l.png)
