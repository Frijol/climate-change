# Infrastructure
* Current American grids: Texas (ERCOT), East, and West. They are separately managed. [Chabot]
* Current grid systems are highly distributed. Power transmission lines are expensive and inefficient - local solar & wind reduces cost and energy production need [Lovins, 72][Lovins]
* The current power grid is not set up to support distributed power; it works through a few sources providing great amounts of energy. [Victor]
* The United States has very few HVDC lines. "The cost of high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines is roughly 1 cents per kwh for 500 miles, or 1.5 cents per kwh for 1,000 miles transmitted. Over 1,000 miles, an HVDC line may lose 5% or so of the electricity it transmits." [Naam][NaamWind]

## Siting: colocation of wind + solar
* Colocation of wind & solar might make sense for renewables because they have ~opposite peaks. It also lets both farms use the same infrastructure [Cuff]
* Colocation of wind and solar in practice [Pattison]: ![https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/54690/3_Pattison_etal.pdf?sequence=2&isAllowed=y](http://i.imgur.com/iCQ3M4l.png)
