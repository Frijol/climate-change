# Tidal Power

## How it works
* Major methods are tidal barrage (essentially a hydroelectric dam: open for inflow, close & run generator on outflow), tidal stream generator (underwater turbine), and dynamic tidal power (not defined but perhaps similar to wave mechanisms?) [Maehlum]
* Tidal stream generators do not generate the high power that tidal barrage can, but is typically less environmentally destructive [Helston]
* Peak-to-trough amplitude of tides would be theoretically ~1m due to solar + lunar gravity on a perfectly fluid Earth. We see more extreme tides (e.g. 4m in Puget Sound) where there are geographical restrictions or shallower water. In an *inlet*, water has to *flow* in & out to accommodate the tide change [Murphy-tides]

### Tidal barrage
* Essentially a hydroelectric dam where sluice gates create the hydrostatic head, thus generating a head differential which can be harvested
* Tidal barrage functions best in inlets/similar places where the water can be trapped and tidal amplitude is high [Murphy-tides]
* Tidal barrage power calculations: P=ρFgh, where ρ = 1000 kg/m³,  g = 10 m/s² (surface gravity), F is the flow rate of water in (m³/s), and h is the height of the water behind the dam. **h** is very small in a tidal installation compared with river hydroelectric (often 200m+). Accounting for timing (outer water has to be higher to create inflow, so you can't harvest the whole tide), ideal power is P = (1/8)πρgAH²/T, where A is the area impounded, H is the peak-to-peak tidal amplitude, and T is the period (about 12 hours) [Murphy-tides]

### Tidal stream generators
* Essentially an underwater turbine in a tidal current

## Drawbacks
* Tidal barrage systems (originally the preferred way to harness tidal power) can negatively effect the environment/aquatic life [Helston]
* Impractical in most of the world [Murphy-tides]
* BC/Southeast Alaska has some of the best tidal current opportunity in the world. Fishing is a major industry, so it is extremely important that any technology is environmentally sound [Helston]

## Economic Feasibility: Alaska
* Alaska has 90% of the United States' potential for tidal power [Palomino]

* Energy is expensive in rural Alaska regardless of its source, so new technologies like tidal turbines might be close to economic parity with imported energy sources (e.g. diesel) [Palomino]
* Cook Inlet near Anchorage is the second biggest source of tidal power in the United States. The city currently depends on nearby natural gas reserves, but the inlet has enough power to supply the city. Ocean Renewable Power Company is currently investigating connecting tidal generators from Cook Inlet to the Railbelt (80% of power supply in Alaska) [Palomino]

## Existing installations
### Tidal barrage
* Sihwa in South Korea: biggest in the world with 254 MW of peak capacity, 30 km² of impound [Murphy-tides]
* Rance installation in France: built 1966, peak capacity of 240 MW, impounds 22.5 km² on an average tidal amplitude of 8 m. Typical generation of 96 MW [Murphy-tides]
* Annapolis Royal tidal barrage in Nova Scotia's Bay of Fundy is the third largest, at 20 mW [Helston]

### Tidal stream generator
* Race Rocks in British Columbia (installed 2006) generates 65 kW
