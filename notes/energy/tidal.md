# Tidal Power

## How it works
* Major methods are tidal barrage (essentially a hydroelectric dam: open for inflow, close & run generator on outflow), tidal stream generator (underwater turbine), and dynamic tidal power (not defined but perhaps similar to wave mechanisms?) [Maehlum]
* Tidal stream generators do not generate the high power that tidal barrage can, but are typically less environmentally destructive [Helston]
* Peak-to-trough amplitude of tides would be theoretically ~1m due to solar + lunar gravity on a perfectly fluid Earth. We see more extreme tides (e.g. 4m in Puget Sound) where there are geographical restrictions or shallower water. In an *inlet*, water has to *flow* in & out to accommodate the tide change [Murphy-tides]

## Tidal barrage
* Energy harvest can be ebb (high tide is trapped in, allowed to outflow through turbines), flood (high tide is trapped out, allowed to inflow through turbines- less popular than ebb because it reduces the size of the basin, impacting shipping and the environment), or two-way (both, with a smaller hydrostatic head & thus a gentler peak generation over more time). [O Rourke, 4][ORourke]
* Essentially a hydroelectric dam where sluice gates create the hydrostatic head, thus generating a head differential which can be harvested
* Tidal barrage functions best in inlets/similar places where the water can be trapped and tidal amplitude is high [Murphy-tides]
* Double basin tidal barrage: ebb system where some of the electricity generated is used to pump water into a second basin & thus save generating capacity for when it is needed. Economically unfeasible (in 2009) because of generator inefficiencies and higher construction costs [O Rourke, 5][ORourke]
* Tidal barrage power calculations: P=ρFgh, where ρ = 1000 kg/m³,  g = 10 m/s² (surface gravity), F is the flow rate of water in (m³/s), and h is the height of the water behind the dam. **h** is very small in a tidal installation compared with river hydroelectric (often 200m+). Accounting for timing (outer water has to be higher to create inflow, so you can't harvest the whole tide), ideal power is P = (1/8)πρgAH²/T, where A is the area impounded, H is the peak-to-peak tidal amplitude, and T is the period (about 12 hours) [Murphy-tides]
* UK is interested in taking a lead with tidal power [Helston]

## Tidal stream generators
* Essentially an underwater turbine in a tidal current
* Tidal fences/tidal farms: a row of turbines through which water flows [Helston]

### Siting
* At least 7m tidal difference [Helston]
* Ideal flow rate is 7-11 km/hr [Helston]
* Stable underwater site for installation [Helston]
* Typically sunk 20-30 meters, anywhere with a strong tidal flow [Helston]
* Environmental disturbances should be minimal [Helston]

### Turbine design
* Two styles: horizontal axis (rotation of blades is parallel to the flow of water) or vertical axis (rotation of blades is perpendicular to the flow of water) [O Rourke, 8][ORourke]
* Simplest design: blades on a hub connected to a gearbox, connected to a generator. Generated electricity is transmitted to land with cables. [O Rourke, 9][ORourke]
* Support structure: three main types. Gravity structure: a large mass (concrete + steel) steadies the turbine. Piled structure: steel or concrete beams pin the turbine to the seabed. Floating structure: turbine is moored to the seafloor (often with wire or chains) and held in position with a downward pointing vertical beam [O Rourke, 9][ORourke]
* Must be able to generate on both ebb and flood (a moving turbine is better at withstanding structural stress than one held still/not generating) [O Rourke, 8][ORourke]
* Water is ~800x denser than air, so turbines are sturdier than wind turbines, with smaller diameters to generate the same power (10-15m rotor diameter can produce 200-700kW) [Helston]

### Technology readiness
* Still in demonstration phase (2011) [Helston]

### Environmental considerations
* A few turbines in a row have a minimal environmental effect, but tidal fences can be susceptible to similar environmental problems as tidal barrage as they can impact the tidal flow [Helston]
* Turbines are designed for low rotation speeds, so they are not a significant danger to aquatic life. Turbines are also sometimes screened to prevent entry by aquatic life. [Helston]
* BC/Southeast Alaska has some of the best tidal current opportunity in the world. Fishing is a major industry, so it is extremely important that any technology is environmentally sound [Helston]

## Benefits
* Highly consistent power sources
* Operation & maintenance costs are typically less than 0.5% of initial capital costs [Helston]
* Mostly emissions-free (installation has some emissions), and as a general trend displaces conventional generation in the area, thus reducing overall emissions [Helston]

## Drawbacks
* Tidal barrage systems (originally the preferred way to harness tidal power) can negatively effect the environment/aquatic life [Helston]
* Tidal turbines might in some sites reduce tidal velocity and therefore the motion of sediment/erosion [Helston]
* The sound generated by tidal turbines can cause changes in water pressure, which could result in tissue damage to fish [Helston] // Read more on this: [DoE report on the subject](http://www.energybc.ca/cache/tidal/PNNL-20786.pdf) "low level of tissue damage" on what they term "worst case" exposure for juvenile Chinook
* Impractical in most of the world [Murphy-tides]

## Economic Feasibility
* La Rance provides at the cost of 3.7c/kWh, BC gvt estimates 11-25c/kWh dropping to 5-7c/kWh for new tidal installations on the BC coast [Helston]

### Alaska
* Alaska has 90% of the United States' potential for tidal power [Palomino]
* Map of hydropower and hydrokinetic projects in Alaska [Palomino] ![http://www.alaskapublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Hydro-Projects-Alaska.png](http://www.alaskapublic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Hydro-Projects-Alaska.png)
* Energy is expensive in rural Alaska regardless of its source, so new technologies like tidal turbines might be close to economic parity with imported energy sources (e.g. diesel) [Palomino]
* Cook Inlet near Anchorage is the second biggest source of tidal power in the United States. The city currently depends on nearby natural gas reserves, but the inlet has enough power to supply the city. Ocean Renewable Power Company is currently investigating connecting tidal generators from Cook Inlet to the Railbelt (80% of power supply in Alaska) [Palomino]

### Questions
* What is the typical power draw of a rural community in Southeast Alaska? Is this a good match for one or two tidal turbines?
* What is the interplay between a tidal turbine site and fishing? Fish also like fast currents at 20-30m deep. Would this interfere? Would it help if it were shut off at slack tide (least flow anyway)? Would it help if it were close to town (shorter wires & presumably less good fishing, but possibly an issue for the turbine itself getting disturbed?)
* Who is behind the current diesel generation systems for rural communities? If local, can these people be retrained to service a tidal turbine? What are the economic impacts of shutting down the diesel plant?

## Existing installations
### Tidal barrage
* Sihwa in South Korea: biggest in the world with 254 MW of peak capacity, 30 km² of impound [Murphy-tides]
* Rance installation in France: built 1966, peak capacity of 240 MW, impounds 22.5 km² on an average tidal amplitude of 8 m. Typical generation of 96 MW [Murphy-tides]
* Annapolis Royal tidal barrage in Nova Scotia's Bay of Fundy is the third largest, at 20 mW [Helston]
* Kislaya Guba in Russia: 1968-present, 400 kW, has a UNESCO ecological monitoring site [Helston]
* Severn Barrage in the UK [Helston]

### Tidal stream generator
* [Race Rocks in British Columbia](https://tethys.pnnl.gov/annex-iv-sites/race-rocks-tidal-energy-project) (installed 2006) generates 65 kW. Cost $4m 2006 CAD to install [Helston]
