# Oil

## Economic trends
* Most energy sources use oil pricing as a benchmark for economic feasibility, but oil prices vary widely in a way not necessarily related to supply/demand - e.g. OPEC artificially restricts supply to drive prices
* As oil price/barrel increases, American oil becomes more economically feasible (primarily in the lower 48) [EIA, 20][EIA]

## Oil availability
* Concept of peak oil:
* The best fit for a resource extraction model is logarithmic, so while we will hit an asymptote on oil (and thus be unable to keep up with increasing demand), we won’t suddenly be out of energy. [Smil, 66][Smil]
* The United States Geographical Survey sets a 95% probability there are 400b barrels of oil that can be extracted from currently known fields. At a current global rate of ~100m barrels consumed per day, this would last us 4000 years [Smil, 68][Smil]
* There are enormous major sedimentary fields both associated with existing land and deep underwater that most likely have a lot of oil. They have not been truly tapped until they have the same density of drilling as Texas. [Smil, 68][Smil]
* Likelihoood of discovering new oil is highest in Mesopotamian Foredeep Basin (north of Baghdad through Iraq & Kuwait to E Saudi Ar), west Siberian Basin, Zagros Fold Belt of SE Iran, Niger Delta, Rub al Khali basin, East Greenland Rift Basin. In N America, northern Alaska, Canadian Arctic, Gulf of Mexico, supplemented by Venezuela, offshore Brazil. In Africa, offshore Congo and Niger, in Algeria, Libya. Asia: Kazakhstan, Timan-Pechora Basin. Europ: Atlantic west of Scotland [Smil, 68][Smil]

## Climate change problems caused by oil extraction
* New oil extraction processes consume much more water than conventional practices. It takes 2.3 barrels of water to produce one barrel of oil from tar sands mining, compared to 0.1-0.3 barres of water for a barrel of conventional crude. [Klein, 312][Klein]
* Bitumen (tar sands oil) is roughly 3-4 times as greenhouse intensive as coal due to its extraction process [Klein, 127][Klein]

## Shale oil
* The United States has about 1.5 trillion barrels of shale oil resource, enough to power the United States for 200 years [Muller, 110][Muller]
* Shale oil is expensive to recover and requires a lot of environmental cleanup when extracted using retorting. Retorting requires massive mining of shale, most of which is then waste to dispose of [Muller, 109][Muller]
* A newer in situ conversion process could make shale oil extraction more feasible: electrically heat deep rock (1-2km down) to 1200-1300 degrees F, then use fracking and horizontal drilling to extract over the course of 3-4 years. Shell is doing this and quotes $30/barrel [Muller, 110][Muller]

## Other
* ExxonMobil is the world's largest multinational oil corporation, Khalid Al-Falh runs Saudi Aramco, the world's largest national oil Corp [Smil, 74][Smil]
