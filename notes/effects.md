# Effects of climate change

## Positive feedback loops
* Global warming reduces the likelihood that we can count on forests and trees as permanent carbon sinks. Sequestration of carbon in forests fluctuates to the extent that some years forests can produce more carbon than they sequester [Smil, 80][Smil]. In the near future, Tropical forests’ carbon impacts will change in the near future mostly due to deforestation, but many other forests will be limited by water and soil nutrient availability, especially a lack of nitrogen. This is one of the effects of global warming. We will also have more carbon-releasing wildfires across these forests due to longer droughts from global warming. [Smil, 82][Smil]

## Continued effects even after we improve
* The IPCC says we get 90 more years of climate change regardless of how much emission we stop. 2007: 385 PPM CO2. No way to avoid 450 PPM by midcentury according to Pew Center on Global Climate Change [Begley]
* In order to have a 50% chance of keeping below the agreed-upon international target of no more than 2 degrees C of warming, all wealthy countries need to start cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 8-10% immediately (2015) [Klein, 81][Klein]

## Poor human health

### Effects on human health from pesticides
* The FDA typically does not ban the presence of toxins in foods, but sets "allowable levels", which means that even approved food can contain enough that toxins build up over time in your body [Carson, 195][Carson]
* Cancer has increased drastically over the past 100-150 years. Malignant growths accounted for 15% of deaths in 1958, compared with 4% in 1900. More American school children [at time of publication] die of cancer than from any other disease, though 25 years previous it was considered medically rare to find cancer in children. [Carson, 231][Carson] //TODO: what are we at now? Office of Vital Statistics as source?
* "It has been medically established that, as common sense would tell us, persons who lived and died before the dawn of the DDT era (about 1942) contained no trace of DDT or any similar material in their tissues. As mentioned in Chapter 3, samples of body fat collected from the general population between 1954 and 1956 averaged from 5.3 to 7.4 parts per million of DDT." In samples of restaurant and institutional meals, the US Public Health Service determined that every meal contained DDT. [Carson, 191][Carson] //TODO: updated stat?
* When a ruminating animal feeds on plants with an unusually high concentration of nitrates, microorganisms in the rumen turn nitrates into nitrites, which act on blood pigment to capture oxygen such that it is not released into the tissues. Animals can die from the resultant anoxia within hours. [Carson, 93][Carson]
* Plant wilt after toxic chemical spray (2,4 D) can create a temporary increase in sugar content, which causes grazing animals to prefer even plants they would normally avoid and ingest the sprayed chemicals [Carson, 93][Carson]
* The FDA's protection against pesticides on crops is limited due to two facts: 1) they have jurisdiction only over foods shipped interstate and 2) there are fewer than 600 workers on its staff, so they can barely sample (let alone enforce regulations) [Carson, 195][Carson] //TODO updated facts?

### Effects on human health from energy extraction
* In 2012, there were more than 6,000 spills and "other mishaps" at onshore oil and gas sites in the Unites States. This is up ~17% from 2010 in states where comparable data was available. [Klein, 299][Klein]
* Cleanups of oil/gas spills are getting less effective: in 2005-2006, pipeline operators report recovering more than 60% of liquids spilled; in 2007-2010, operators recovered less than a third. [Klein, 299][Klein]
* More than 15 million Americans live within a mile of a well that has been drilled and fracked since 2000 [Klein, 282][Klein]
* The number of oil-carrying rail cars has increased from 9,500 in 2008 to 400,000 in 2013 (4,111% in five years) [Klein, 280][Klein]
* Gas flaring in Nigeria is extremely damaging. If the natural gas were captured, it could power the entire country. Instead, it is set on fire and accounts for 40% of Nigeria's CO2 emissions. [Klein, 275][Klein]
* In Nigeria, foreign-investment oil has spilled an Exxon Valdez worth of oil on the Niger Delta every year for ~50 years [Klein, 275][Klein]
* Principles from the "golden age" of environmental legislation: ban/severely limit the offending activity/substance. Where possible, get the offender to pay for the cleanup. [Klein, 183][Klein]

## Mass extinctions
* For millions of years, the average rate of extinction was one species per century. Most of the extinctions since prehistoric times were in the last 300 years. Of those, over half took place in the last 50 years. Of those, over half took place in the last 10 years. There are currently more than 1000 different species of plants and animals becoming extinct every year. Mark Cawardine, in [Adams, 241][Adams]
* There have been five major extinction events in known natural history where species diversity plummeted in a short period of time – called the "Big Five". We are currently in a period of possibly similar extinction event proportions, likely caused by humans. Theorists are already terming this the "Sixth Extinction." [Kolbert, 3][Kolbert]
* The change in temperature projected by 2100 is ~as big as the temperature swings of the ice ages, but at least 10 times faster. In order for organisms to survive, they will have to adapt an order of magnitude faster than they have before. [Kolbert, 161-162][Kolbert]
* Species-area relationship: S = cA^z where z is less than 1. S=number of species, A=area, c=some constant (asymptotal graph). As conditions change, directly or indirectly by climate, a species's ability to adapt or move (incl. dispersal over generations) to stay in favorable conditions determines its survival. Based on this, about 24% (pretty definitely this order of magnitude) of species will be committed to extinction by 2050 if current climate change rates continue. This puts the current extinction at a "lesser" extinction level compared to the earth's history, not quite on par with a big five extinction event [Kolbert, 166-168][Kolbert]
* Salmon as particular case study: 5 major factors influencing are harvest (overfishing), hydropower (dams), habitat, hatcheries [Montgomery, 5][Montgomery]
* Salmon runs in the Pacific Northwest are stronger when the ocean's surface climate is cooler. This happens with a periodicity (opposite Alaska's) every 25 to 30 years. Cooler in 2001ish [Montgomery, 43][Montgomery]

## Glacier retreat
* In Glacier Bay (AK), ice front surveyed by Cook in late 1700s retreated 50 miles by 1980s [Montgomery, 32][Montgomery]
* Glacier National Park in the late 1800s had over 150 glaciers, 35 in 2005, at current rates 0 by 2030 [Diamond, 37][Diamond]
* As of May 2014, glacier melt in a section of West Antarctica (~the size of France) "appears unstoppable"[Klein, 16][Klein]

## Desertification
* Desertification: forces massive migration of villages (and cities) [Larsson]
* In order to stop desertification, you need to make something that will catch sand and keep it from blowing past its borders and taking in more land. E.g. wall of trees [Larsson]
* Around the Sahara, people are often poor and will chop down trees planted as sandbreak for firewood. Larsson proposes sandbreak made of sandstone, hardened by some bugs [Larsson]

# Flooding
* If the West Antarctic ice sheet disintegrates (could take centuries), the sea level will rise 3-5m [Klein, 16][Klein]
* Major cities that will likely disappear under a rising ocean: Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Vancouver, London, Mumbai, Hong Kong, Shanghai [Klein, 14][Klein]

# Adaptation
* Adaptation to climate change effects has become an emerging market segment. [Lovins, 252][Lovins]
* Some worry that focus on adaptation will create financial incentives for climate change acceleration. Others argue that we will need adaptation services/technologies regardless of how fast we curb emissions, so we should start now.
* Villages and roads that used to be on the (melting) permafrost will need rebuilding/relocating. Floods are coming and we need sea-wall design and implementation (esp. for storm surges), inland areas need efficient space use for coastal climate refugees to occupy, power lines will need to be more resistant to extreme climates esp. ice. Alaska is figuring out how to relocate villages from flooding. California needs to get better at firefighting and desalination because heat and drought are only getting worse. Also need bridges higher than before for storm surges. Heat waves get dangerous, we need early warning systems for these (e.g. senior centers) [Begley]
* Cities (New York, Seattle) and states (California, Alaska, Maryland, Oregon, Washington) have adaptation plans [Begley] //TODO: read these
