# Causes of climate change

## Energy extraction
* **The amount of carbon that can be burned between 2011 and 2049 to have a 50% chance of keeping global warming below 2 degrees celcius is 565 gigatons. Reserves already claimed by all fossil fuel companies for oil, gas, and coal amounts to 2,795 gigatons of carbon.** [Klein, 134][Klein]
* New oil extraction processes consume much more water than conventional practices. It takes 2.3 barrels of water to produce one barrel of oil from tar sands mining, compared to 0.1-0.3 barres of water for a barrel of conventional crude. [Klein, 312][Klein]
* Modern fracking takes 70-300x the amount of fluid (usually water + sand) used in traditional fracking. This fluid often becomes toxic, radioactive waste. 280 billions of this waste were created from fracking in 2012. [Klein, 312][Klein]
* Methane has a warming potential 86 times greater than carbon dioxide [Klein, 130][Klein]
* Bitumen is roughly 3-4 times as greenhouse intensive as coal due to its extraction process [Klein, 127][Klein]
* Natural gas has been argued for as a "clean alternative" to oil, but fracked natural gas may emit enough methane to make it comparable in "dirtiness" to coal [Klein, 192][Klein]
* The vast majority of new gas projects in North America rely on fracking [Klein, 192][Klein]

## Poor societal response
* Eight categories of environmentally based societal collapse: deforestation/habitat destruction, soil erosion/salinization/fertility loss, water management issues, overhunting, overfishing, non-native species effects, overpopulation (human), high impact per capita [Diamond, 15][Diamond]
* Five factors in societal collapse: environmental damage, climate change, hostile neighbors, friendly trade partners (these four optional), and society's response to its problems (always significant) [Diamond, 13][Diamond]
* Past societal collapse theme: a series of good years --> population growth --> intensified (unsustainable) agriculture --> adoption of marginal lands for agriculture and interdependence (trade) --> environmental damage --> inability to continue using marginal lands --> poor resilience due to interdependence, food shortages --> starvation/war/weakness and disease, etc. [Diamond, 15, 97][Diamond]
* Difference between modern world and past societies which collapsed. Risk-lowering differences: tech advances, globalization, medicine, knowledge of other societies. Risk-heightening differences: unintended effects of tech, global interdependence, dependence on modern medicine for survival, enormous population [Diamond, 11][Diamond]
* Global emissions dipped in 2009 (likely due to the financial crisis) and increased 5.9% in 2010 - largest absolute increase since the Industrial Revolution [Klein, 20][Klein]
* The ~500 million richest humans on earth are responsible for about half of global emissions [Klein, 104][Klein]
* Public spending on the level of wartime expenditures need to occur in order to prevent catastrophic levels of global warming and to mitigate the effects which will reach us. This is largely energy efficiency and public transit expenditure. [Klein, 99][Klein]
* In the neoliberal era, the rate of emissions growth had been declining: 4.5% annual increases in the 1960s were down to 1% annual increase in the 1990s. Between 2000 and 2008, they shot up to 3.4%/year [Klein, 74][Klein]
* Countries are currently allocated responsible for emissions created in their country, not for emissions caused by their consumption. Shipping/etc. in the open ocean is not accounted for. [Klein, 73][Klein]

### Failure in carbon credit system implementation
* Poor implementation: companies which do tons of emissions have gamed the system by cheaply burning part of the toxic chemicals they spew, generating millions of dollars in carbon credits - sometimes worth more than the original business. A sort of encouragement to build a dirty business and then green it a little for profit. [Klein, 197][Klein]
* Companies operating in the Niger Delta trying to claim carbon credits for stopping gas flaring [Klein, 196][Klein]

## Agriculture
* Modern agriculture is highly connected with climate change, particularly: practices dependent on fossil fuels, land usage and deforestation, chemical sprays (herbicides, fungicides, fertilizers, etc.), transportation/refrigeration/packaging/retail [Lovins, 178][Lovins]
* American farms overproduce to the extent that in 1962 the government subsidized at more than $1bn/year in surplus food storage [Carson, 27][Carson] //TODO: updated stat?
* Saline seep is occurring in Montana. The minerals in the area are naturally salty, but native vegetation typically keeps minerals from dissolving. Ground cover killing herbicides and tractor use are interfering with this system and causing downhill land to become toxic and unarable. [Diamond, 37][Diamond]

## Deforestation
* Immediate effects of deforestation on Easter Island: damages to soil, decreased crop yields. Further consequences: starvation, population crash, cannibalism [Diamond, 74][Diamond]
