# Renewable energy
* Hoped-for breakthrough technologies: fusion reactors, nanoscale solar cells [Victor]
* "clean coal": idea whereby coal-fired plants capture CO2 before it leaves the smokestack and bury it (sequester) in the earth. Mechanism: pressurized CO2 injected into saline aquifers below impermeable caprock - 1k-8k feet deep. There, it would form mild carbonic acid, which would dissolve and precipitate out as dolomite and limestone [Weisman, 223][Weisman]

## Geothermal
* Geothermal: requires hot rock and water (so e.g. island volcanic areas). Porous rock sponges up rainfall, volcano heats this. Dig a hole to create a vent, then hook up a turbine to get power. Iceland uses geothermal for 25% of its electricity and 90% of its heating/hot water needs [Lovins, 75][Lovins]
* One nuclear power plant produces 1gW. Geothermal across the states produces 2gW [Lovins]

## Wave
* Wave power by Pelamis: semi-submerged articulated structure undulates, pushing hydraulic rams, which pump fluids through hydraulic motors to generate electricity [Lovins, 77][Lovins]
* Wave + hydroelectric power by Aquamarine Power's Oyster: a hinged flap connected to the seabed 30m down moves with the waves. This drives a hydraulic piston, which shoots high-pressure water to an onshore turbine [Lovins, 78][Lovins]

## Power grid - implementation changes
* Current American grids: Texas (ERCOT), East, and West. They are separately managed. [Chabot]
* Current grid systems are highly distributed. Power transmission lines are expensive and inefficient - local solar & wind reduces cost and energy production need [Lovins, 72][Lovins]
* The current power grid is not set up to support distributed power; it works through a few sources providing great amounts of energy. [Victor]
* The United States has very few HVDC lines. "The cost of high voltage DC (HVDC) transmission lines is roughly 1 cents per kwh for 500 miles, or 1.5 cents per kwh for 1,000 miles transmitted. Over 1,000 miles, an HVDC line may lose 5% or so of the electricity it transmits." [Naam][NaamWind]
