# What is the "Notes" section?
As I'm reading, facts and ideas that stand out. These are mostly organized into the subsections.

disorganized notes or sections I don't have filled out yet

* Climate change predictions have been underpredicted 20% more often than they have been overpredicted in the past 20 years [Brysse]
* In a 1995 survey published in the MIT Press, a substantial majority justified environmental protection by explicitly invoking God's name as creator. From the article, "It seems that divine creation is the closest concept American culture provides to express the sacredness of nature. Regardless of whether one actually believes in biblical Creation, it is the best vehicle we have to express this value." [Louv, 248][Louv]
* No country, as of 2000, uses local power as a major (even non-negligible) energy source [Smil, 49][Smil]
* The best fit for a resource extraction model is logarithmic, so while we will hit an asymptote on oil (and thus be unable to keep up with increasing demand), we won’t suddenly be out of energy. [Smil, 66][Smil]
* Energy transitions are slow by nature. Oil took 50 years to climb from first commercial production to a 10% market share, and we continue to depend on prior dominant energy forms: coal, wood [Smil, 138][Smil]
* Quick energy transitions destabilize economies. Any new technology adoption requires a heavy up-front investment (estimated by Smil at at least $3 trillion). This is needed both in the energy sourcing and transport infrastructures, and in the “primary movers”, the major users of the new energy (such as cars). Primary movers take years to become efficient [Smil, 138][Smil].
* Quick changes in primary energy sources leaves less time to build infrastructure and primary movers. Transition also requires people who had invested in the old system to write off of that infrastructure investment [Smil, 142][Smil]
* From data up to 2008, we are not currently transitioning off of oil. In 2008, energy from new renewable energy sources was less than 2.4% in the United States. [Smil, 135][Smil]
* Britain: Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction's climate model is one of the world's top 3 [Pearce, 66][Pearce]
* Hadley model predicts that if climate emissions continue at current trends, the Amazon rainforest will be gone by 2100: "able to support only shrubs or grass at most" because of warmer seas > droughts > threshold forest fire conditions > huge fires across the rainforest [Hadley study in 2005, in Pearce, 66][Pearce]
* Death of the Amazon rainforest (as predicted by 2100 assuming current emissions trends continue) would release enough carbon to increase expected rate of global warming by 50%+ (77b currently stored down to 16.5b by 2100) [Pearce, 66][Pearce]
* Methane emissions from thawing peat bogs in Western Siberia are up to 100k tons/day, a greater warming effect than U.S. man-made emissions [Pearce, 79][Pearce]
* Stordalen mire: well-monitored permafrost peat bog in northern Sweden that is beginning to break up [Pearce, 82][Pearce]
* 1-10t tons of methane is currently held by clathrates [Pearce, 92][Pearce]
* On average, storms last 60% longer and have wind speeds 15% higher in the 2000s than they did in the 1950s [Pearce, 215][Pearce]
* **History of carbon in the atmosphere:** 440b tons at the coldest part of the last ice age, 660b tons at the start of the Industrial Revolution (largely from the ocean). 2007: 880b tons. **Current estimate for "safe" level of carbon:** no more than 935b tons to get a 50% chance of staying below internationally recognized "dangerous" temperature rise. This is 55b tons more than already in the atmosphere in 2007. **Current rate of emission:** 8.2b tons/year emitted, ~60% stays in the atmosphere - so 4.4b tons/year. **That puts us crossing the "safe" threshold around 2020.** [Pearce, 242][Pearce]
* Per-capita human impact: average resource consumption and waste production of one person. A society's total impact is per-capita impact multiplied by population. [Diamond, 353][Diamond]
* China has only 0.3 acres of forest/person. World average is 1.6 [Diamond, 365][Diamond]
* China's environmental problems: air pollution, biodiversity loss, cropland loss, desertification, shrinking wetlands, grassland degradation, increased natural disasters (both size and quantity), invasive species, overgrazing, river flow cessation, salinization, soil erosion, trash accumulation, water pollution, shortages [Diamond, 359][Diamond]
* 60% of Australia's land use and 80% of its human water use are for agriculture, but agriculture contributes less than 3% of the GDP. Most of the land (>99%) thus engaged is uneconomically viable without government subsidy; the only truly profitable agriculture is <0.8% of that agricultural land [Diamond, 413][Diamond]
* Australian public environmentalism focuses on land clearance, river development, and old-growth logging [Diamond, 410][Diamond]
* China's Grain to Green program (started 2000) gives subsidies to farmers who convert farmland  to forest or grassland [Diamond, 377][Diamond]
* China reaching first world living standards (at current first world consumption rates) would double the world's human environmental impact [Diamond, 374][Diamond]
* Health impacts in China: average blood lead levels in urban Chinese are double "dangerously high" levels in other parts of the world, 300k deaths and $54b in health care are attributable to pollution [Diamond, 329][Diamond]
* World's largest development projects (all expected to be severely damaging to the environment): Three Gorges Dam, South-to-North Water Diversion Project [Diamond, 368][Diamond]
* Droughts affect 30% of China's cropland every year [Diamond, 367][Diamond]
* Deforestation is a major contributor to China's soil erosion and floods [Diamond, 366][Diamond]
* China is a net importer of trash from other countries, and recycles very little. More than 2/3 of China's cities are surrounded by garbage [Diamond, 366][Diamond]
* China is short on water, especially in the north. Water supply in the north is 1/5 per capita that it is in the south; shortages occasionally halt industrial production. 2/3 of city + irrigation water is from groundwater aquifers, which are beginning to salinate in coastal areas and collapse in emptier inland ones [Diamond, 365][Diamond]
* China's industrial energy efficiency is half that of first world countries [Diamond, 362][Diamond]
* Transportation in China is explosively growing. # of motor vehicles increased 15x 1980-2001. [Diamond, 362][Diamond]
* China uses 3x the world average of fertilizer per acre [Diamond, 362][Diamond]
* China's number of households has been grew at 3.5%/year 1990-2005 [Diamond, 361][Diamond]
* "creeping normalcy": the idea that slow trends are concealed within noisy fluctuations, such that they can't be discerned by people who have experienced the slow change. E.g. do we experience more heat waves now than when I was a child? We had a lot two years ago, just a few last year. But I don't remember if we ever had more than one per year when I was seven. [Diamond, 69.4%][Diamond]
* "landscape amnesia": forgetting how different the landscape used to look because the change has been gradual. E.g. lack of snow in the summer on a mountaintop may seem normal if it has gradually disappeared over 50 years but is shocking to someone who had never seen it bare from a childhood 50 years previous [Diamond, 69.4%][Diamond]
* energy return on energy invested (EROEI): you have to use some energy to get the energy you need to use. Changing ratios provide a useful look at energy pinch points. Oil was originally ~100:1, now it's closer to 20:1.

| Fuel                      | EROEI   |
|---------------------------|---------|
| Natural gas               | 20-40:1 |
| Oil                       |    20:1 |
| Wind                      |    20:1 |
| Nuclear (new)             |    15:1 |
| Solar                     |    10:1 |
| Sugar cane ethanol        |     8:1 |
| Tar sands                 |     5:1 |
| Shale oil                 |     3:1 |
| Corn ethanol (optimistic) |   1.4:1 |

## Electric cars
* Hybrid cars have taken more than 10 years to claim less than 3 percent of the market [Smil, 25][Smil]
* In large cities (where electric cars for commute make the most sense), 30–60% of cars are parked curbside. Since most electric car scenarios envision overnight charging in garages, how would these curb-parked cars be charged? [Smil, 25][Smil]
* Most published scenarios put likely share of pure electric cars at no more than 25% by 2050 [Smil, 25][Smil]
* We don’t produce enough energy to charge 100% of cars, and can’t scale up to it quickly. Assuming that the overall demand of a midsized electric car is around 6MW/year, if all American cars suddenly became electric, we would immediately need new power generation equal to 25% of all of the energy used in the United States in 2008. [Smil, 26][Smil] We can’t produce that much more energy soon. It took 15 years (1993–2008) to spin up that quantity of power the last time we did. [Smil, 26][Smil]
