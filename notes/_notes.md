# What is the "Notes" section?
As I'm reading, facts and ideas that stand out. These are mostly organized into the subsections.

disorganized notes or sections I don't have filled out yet

* Climate change predictions have been underpredicted 20% more often than they have been overpredicted in the past 20 years [Brysse]
* "Today, peak electricity demand in the US happens during the afternoons and early evenings. Electricity demand in the US is higher in summer months than in winter months. (Note that this pattern differs in Europe, where energy-intensive air-conditioning is less common than the US.) Wind power patterns are nearly the opposite of US electricity demand patterns. Winds tend to max out overnight and in winter months." [Naam][NaamWind]
* Pan Yue (China's Deputy Minister of the Environment) in [Lorenz] "Of course I am pleased with the success of China's economy. But at the same time I am worried. We are using too many raw materials to sustain this growth. To produce goods worth $10,000, for example, we need seven times more resources than Japan, nearly six times more than the United States and, perhaps most embarrassing, nearly three times more than India. Things can't, nor should they be allowed to go on like that. ... Currently, there are 1.3 billion people living in China, that's twice as many as 50 years ago. In 2020, there will be 1.5 billion people in China. Cities are growing but desert areas are expanding at the same time; habitable and usable land has been halved over the past 50 years. ... the environment can no longer keep pace. Acid rain is falling on one third of the Chinese territory, half of the water in our seven largest rivers is completely useless, while one fourth of our citizens does not have access to clean drinking water. One third of the urban population is breathing polluted air, and less than 20 percent of the trash in cities is treated and processed in an environmentally sustainable manner. Finally, five of the ten most polluted cities worldwide are in China. ... Because air and water are polluted, we are losing between 8 and 15 percent of our gross domestic product. And that doesn't include the costs for health. Then there's the human suffering: In Bejing alone, 70 to 80 percent of all deadly cancer cases are related to the environment. Lung cancer has emerged as the No. 1 cause of death. ... the western regions of China and the country's ecologically stressed regions can no longer support the people already living there. In the future, we will need to resettle 186 million residents from 22 provinces and cities. However, the other provinces and cities can only absorb some 33 million people. That means China will have more than 150 million ecological migrants, or, if you like, environmental refugees." Pan Yue, in [Lorenz]
* Energy storage in large Lithium-Ion batteries: ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/How-Cheap-Can-Lithium-Ion-Batteries-Get-Energy-Storage-800x422.jpg) [Naam][NaamStorage]
* Lithium-Ion batteries are in the 10-25c/kwH range (compared with 7c/kwH for natural gas) for the forseeable future, but this is not a whole accounting. Batteries are a load flattener, so we can use any existing & new generators more evenly + reduce need for peaker plants. This graph makes even the 25c/kwH price look plausible: ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CA-Time-of-Use-Pricing-Model-400x134.png) [Naam][NaamStorage]
* Lithium-Ion batteries die out after ~1k cycles & are better to discharge only 70%; Flow can be used for 5-10k cycles, CAES for 10k+ with full discharge [Naam][NaamStorage]
* CAES batteries don't leak the way traditional Lithium-Ion batteries do. CAES batteries can be stored for years [Naam][NaamStorage]
* In a 1995 survey published in the MIT Press, a substantial majority justified environmental protection by explicitly invoking God's name as creator. From the article, "It seems that divine creation is the closest concept American culture provides to express the sacredness of nature. Regardless of whether one actually believes in biblical Creation, it is the best vehicle we have to express this value." [Louv, 248][Louv]
* EPA warns that indoor air pollution is the United States' number one environmental threat to health, 2-10x worse than outdoor air pollution [Louv, 112][Louv]
* Growing body of evidence suggests that quality of exposure to nature has large effects on human health and child development [Louv, 39][Louv]
* USDA projects forests declining from 767,000 acres (1982) to 377,000 acres (2022). [Louv, 29][Louv]
* "...in India and China some 200 million people have emerged from poverty in the last 30 years, most of them moving from low-impact village life to middle-class life in urban areas. But, as economists point out, there are still 200 million behind them , and another 200 million behind them ... all waiting their turn. Their governments will not be able to dey them, and they will not deny themselves, an American style of life." [Friedman, 64][Friedman]
* "In 2006, members of the OPEC oil cartel earned $506 billion from oil exports. In 2007, OPEC income rose to roughly $535 billion, and it was expected to surge to over $600 billion in 2008." [Friedman, 79][Friedman]
* Friedman's "First Law of Petropolitics": As the price of oil goes up, the pace of freedom goes down; and as the price of oil goes down, the pace of freedom goes up [Friedman, 81][Friedman]
* "I first hear the term 'energy poverty from Robert, Freling ... The right of every person to have access to energy is as fundamental as the right to access to air and water, Freling argues." [Friedman, 155][Friedman]
* OPEC drove rise in oil prices less than $2/barrel 1973 to more than $11/barrel in 1974, not in response to supply shortage [Smil, 1][Smil]
* Hybrid cars have taken more than 10 years to claim less than 3 percent of the market [Smil, 25][Smil]
* In large cities (where electric cars for commute make the most sense), 30–60% of cars are parked curbside. Since most electric car scenarios envision overnight charging in garages, how would these curb-parked cars be charged? [Smil, 25][Smil]
* Most published scenarios put likely share of pure electric cars at no more than 25% by 2050 [Smil, 25][Smil]
* We don’t produce enough energy to charge 100% of cars, and can’t scale up to it quickly. Assuming that the overall demand of a midsized electric car is around 6MW/year, if all American cars suddenly became electric, we would immediately need new power generation equal to 25% of all of the energy used in the United States in 2008. [Smil, 26][Smil] We can’t produce that much more energy soon. It took 15 years (1993–2008) to spin up that quantity of power the last time we did. [Smil, 26][Smil]
* Battery performance is sub-par and degrades quickly. Lithium ion batteries lose power even when idle and their performance degrades over time and with temperature. Tesla engineers expect the car battery pack to degrade by as much as 30% in 5 years [Smil, 29][Smil]
* No country, as of 2000, uses local power as a major (even non-negligible) energy source [Smil, 49][Smil]
* The best fit for a resource extraction model is logarithmic, so while we will hit an asymptote on oil (and thus be unable to keep up with increasing demand), we won’t suddenly be out of energy. [Smil, 66][Smil]
* The United States Geographical Survey sets a 95% probability there are 400b barrels of oil that can be extracted from currently known fields. At a current global rate of ~100m barrels consumed per day, this would last us 4000 years [Smil, 68][Smil]
* There are enormous major sedimentary fields both associated with existing land and deep underwater that most likely have a lot of oil. They have not been truly tapped until they have the same density of drilling as Texas. [Smil, 68][Smil]
* Likelihoood of discovering new oil is highest in Mesopotamian Foredeep Basin (north of Baghdad through Iraq & Kuwait to E Saudi Ar), west Siberian Basin, Zagros Fold Belt of SE Iran, Niger Delta, Rub al Khali basin, East Greenland Rift Basin. In N America, northern Alaska, Canadian Arctic, Gulf of Mexico, supplemented by Venezuela, offshore Brazil. In Africa, offshore Congo and Niger, in Algeria, Libya. Asia: Kazakhstan, Timan-Pechora Basin. Europ: Atlantic west of Scotland [Smil, 68][Smil]
* ExxonMobil is the world's largest multinational oil corporation, Khalid Al-FAlh runs Saudi Aramco, the world's largest national oil Corp [Smil, 74][Smil]
