# What is the "Notes" section?
As I'm reading, facts and ideas that stand out. These are mostly organized into the subsections.

# Stubs
disorganized notes or sections I don't have filled out yet

* Climate change predictions have been underpredicted 20% more often than they have been overpredicted in the past 20 years [Brysse]
* In a 1995 survey published in the MIT Press, a substantial majority justified environmental protection by explicitly invoking God's name as creator. From the article, "It seems that divine creation is the closest concept American culture provides to express the sacredness of nature. Regardless of whether one actually believes in biblical Creation, it is the best vehicle we have to express this value." [Louv, 248][Louv]
* No country, as of 2000, uses local power as a major (even non-negligible) energy source [Smil, 49][Smil]
* The best fit for a resource extraction model is logarithmic, so while we will hit an asymptote on oil (and thus be unable to keep up with increasing demand), we won’t suddenly be out of energy. [Smil, 66][Smil]

## Electric cars
* Hybrid cars have taken more than 10 years to claim less than 3 percent of the market [Smil, 25][Smil]
* In large cities (where electric cars for commute make the most sense), 30–60% of cars are parked curbside. Since most electric car scenarios envision overnight charging in garages, how would these curb-parked cars be charged? [Smil, 25][Smil]
* Most published scenarios put likely share of pure electric cars at no more than 25% by 2050 [Smil, 25][Smil]
* We don’t produce enough energy to charge 100% of cars, and can’t scale up to it quickly. Assuming that the overall demand of a midsized electric car is around 6MW/year, if all American cars suddenly became electric, we would immediately need new power generation equal to 25% of all of the energy used in the United States in 2008. [Smil, 26][Smil] We can’t produce that much more energy soon. It took 15 years (1993–2008) to spin up that quantity of power the last time we did. [Smil, 26][Smil]
