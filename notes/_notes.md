# What is the "Notes" section?
As I'm reading, facts and ideas that stand out. These are mostly organized into the subsections.

# Stubs
disorganized notes or sections I don't have filled out yet

* "creeping normalcy": the idea that slow trends are concealed within noisy fluctuations, such that they can't be discerned by people who have experienced the slow change. E.g. do we experience more heat waves now than when I was a child? We had a lot two years ago, just a few last year. But I don't remember if we ever had more than one per year when I was seven. [Diamond, 69.4%][Diamond]
* "landscape amnesia": forgetting how different the landscape used to look because the change has been gradual. E.g. lack of snow in the summer on a mountaintop may seem normal if it has gradually disappeared over 50 years but is shocking to someone who had never seen it bare from a childhood 50 years previous [Diamond, 69.4%][Diamond]

## China
* World's largest development projects (all expected to be severely damaging to the environment): Three Gorges Dam, South-to-North Water Diversion Project (China) [Diamond, 368][Diamond]
* China is a net importer of trash from other countries, and recycles very little. More than 2/3 of China's cities are surrounded by garbage [Diamond, 366][Diamond]
* China's industrial energy efficiency is half that of first world countries [Diamond, 362][Diamond]
* Transportation in China is explosively growing. # of motor vehicles increased 15x 1980-2001. [Diamond, 362][Diamond]
* China's number of households grew at 3.5%/year 1990-2005 [Diamond, 361][Diamond]

## Electric cars
* Hybrid cars have taken more than 10 years to claim less than 3 percent of the market [Smil, 25][Smil]
* In large cities (where electric cars for commute make the most sense), 30–60% of cars are parked curbside. Since most electric car scenarios envision overnight charging in garages, how would these curb-parked cars be charged? [Smil, 25][Smil]
* Most published scenarios put likely share of pure electric cars at no more than 25% by 2050 [Smil, 25][Smil]
* We don’t produce enough energy to charge 100% of cars, and can’t scale up to it quickly. Assuming that the overall demand of a midsized electric car is around 6MW/year, if all American cars suddenly became electric, we would immediately need new power generation equal to 25% of all of the energy used in the United States in 2008. [Smil, 26][Smil] We can’t produce that much more energy soon. It took 15 years (1993–2008) to spin up that quantity of power the last time we did. [Smil, 26][Smil]
