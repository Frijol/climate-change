# Policy solutions for climate change

* RPS does spur renewables integration, but the % renewable does not map 1:1 into GHG improvements. For example, lower (or more frequently changing) output from traditional plants can cause them to operate at lower efficiency & be more polluting per energy generated [CPUC, 6][CPUC] 
* A policy is "investment-grade" when it reduces uncertainty. It shifts risk to parties that can best manage it, causing it to offer return commensurate with risk and thus driving private investment. This makes a transition affordable [Aggarwal, 7][Aggarwal]
* Factors in making policy investment-grade: policy certainty/longevity/stability to support long payback periods; long-term certainty about price or about access to markets; contract sanctity esp. with utilities as buyers; few non-price barriers (such as permitting); grid is accessible; application processing should not take long [Aggarwal, 7][Aggarwal]
* Energy policy should incentivize delivery of the best energy service, not the most electrons. Optimize for high reliability, reasonable cost, and strong environmental performance. Policy sets emphasis in balancing these factors. [Aggarwal, 10, 12][Aggarwal]

[Aggarwal, 13][Aggarwal]

* Revenue decoupling: an example of performance-based regulation (regulation towards a specific goal). Utility's financial health is separated from the volume of product it moves and re-coupled to e.g. energy efficiency, reliability of service, etc. to align goals with customer needs [Aggarwal, 21][Aggarwal]


## Incentives
* Germany is a model for adoption of solar: ![screen shot 2017-03-23 at 10 28 45 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/454690/24261569/a1e973c2-0fb4-11e7-923e-6625b57c368e.png) [EPRI, 10][EPRI]
* German PV and wind adoption are driven by the German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) which created FIT for solar and wind. These sources are now cheap enough that FIT has droped from €0.50/kWh to €0.18 but solar + wind continue to grow [EPRI, 11][EPRI]

## Taxing and subsidies
* Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies globally would conservatively save governments $775 billion in one year [Klein, 105][Klein]
* A tax of $50/metric ton of CO2 emitted in developed countries would raise ~$450 billion annually [Klein, 105][Klein]
* The United States provides a tax credit for the first 10 years of operation of new renewables: $0.023/kWh for wind, geothermal, closed-loop biomass; $0.012/kWh for other eligible technologies. [Energy.govPTC]

## Utility Policy

* Decoupling plus: energy policy designed to get utilities to make efficiency investments on the public's behalf and share the profits. Efficiency return on investment per dollar is about 2.5x better than new capacity. State agrees that if utility spends to hit specific efficiency metrics, rates can rise specific amount. So in theory the ratepayers pay less even with higher rates because they use less; utilities spend less than they would have had to to meet growing demand [Muller, 120-121][Muller]

### Renewable portfolio standards (RPS)
* Most of American States (29/50) have established RPS (or similar) to require a specific percentages of renewables. They are largely meeting/exceeding them! Here's why: (1) Federal incentives work! New renewables plants are coming online nationwide, creating options for states to buy from (2) Falling costs from renewables technology - economies of scale + increased efficiency of maturing technology (3) Clean Power Plan - which is currently stayed, but which states are acting on anyway just in case (4) State/local rebates on equipment & similar upfront capital incentives (5) State/local net metering & similar revenue incentives [EIA, 37][EIA]
* See RPS requirements and qualifying technologies at [EIA, 38][EIA]
* Some states allow ACP, which is similar to indulgences if not implemented at high enough cost
* States often regulate RPS and efficiency targets separately [EIA, 44][EIA]

## Carbon credits
* Carbon credits system: a global economic system to financially incentivize companies to reduce their carbon emissions [Goodell, 142][Goodell]
* [Kyoto Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol) established the carbon credits system in 1997/enforced 2005. [Goodell, 142][Goodell]
* Carbon credits are a part of a "cap and trade" mechanism. Governments set upper limits on allowable greenhouse gas emissions by industry and region. Companies that use less than their allotment can sell their "unused" credits to companies that will exceed their cap. [Lovins, 225][Lovins]
* Prior art: the Acid Rain Program cut sulfur dioxide emissions quickly and cheaply using a similar credits system [Goodell, 141][Goodell]
* CPP, if implemented as mass-based (rather than rate-based, implementation flexible by state) would be a national carbon credit system [EIA, 37][EIA]

### Implementation in the United States
#### Clean Power Plan
* Obama administration/EPA passed the CPP to reduce coal usage domestically. It's currently held up in the DC court under investigation for having a too-sweeping effect on industry (targeting coal). Proponents assert that EPA has the legal responsibility to pass targets to protect citizens from emissions; detractors say something with such industry-level effects should require passage through congress. Verdict is expected Feb. 2017 [story on initial block](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/u-s-supreme-court-blocks-obama-s-clean-power-plan/) [update as of Sep 2016](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/epa-s-clean-power-plan-does-well-in-court/)
* CPP would have a bigger effect than fuel prices on the country's total CO2 emissions over the 2015-2040 period [EIA, 24][EIA]

#### Regional implementations
* RGGI is currently functioning in the Northeast [EIA, 57][EIA]
* Global Warming Solutions Act is in effect in California [EIA, 57][EIA]

### Kyoto Protocol implementation details
* Flexible mechanism: the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) carbon offset projects in developing countries [presumably, with unregulated markets] can be used to generate credits sellable in regulated markets [Lovins, 226][Lovins]
* Flexible mechanism: Joint Implementation (JI) allows a country to claim offset credits generated outside its borders (in developed countries) [Lovins, 226][Lovins]
* First phase of Kyoto Protocol ended 2012
* EU ETS formed to meet Kyoto Protocol obligations, committing to an emission reduction of at least 20% by 2020 over 1990 levels [Lovins, 228][Lovins]
* United States Government did not establish an ETS or ratify the international accord. [Lovins, 229][Lovins]
* CCX became the de facto United States carbon market on an opt-in basis in 2003. Major companies opted in to prepare for future legislation, for good marketing, and other reasons. Some success was had but it was closed in 2010 [Lovins, 229-231][Lovins]
* Regional systems started to put carbon markets in place when no federal ones appeared, starting with RGGI. Western Climate Initiative (Arizona, California, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington) followed in 2007. [Lovins, 232][Lovins]

### Failure in carbon credit system implementation
* Poor implementation: companies which do tons of emissions have gamed the system by cheaply burning part of the toxic chemicals they spew, generating millions of dollars in carbon credits - sometimes worth more than the original business. A sort of encouragement to build a dirty business and then green it a little for profit. [Klein, 197][Klein]
* Companies operating in the Niger Delta trying to claim carbon credits for stopping gas flaring [Klein, 196][Klein]

### Controversy

#### Pro carbon credits
* The system sets a cap on the total allowable quantity of emissions globally (in theory)
* The mechanism creates a "scarcity" of allowable emissions and thus lets market dynamics make reduced emissions a good business decision (you don't just save money, but stand to make some)

#### Anti carbon credits
* This is challenging to regulate and enforce
* The carbon credit system is an opt-in economy, and many major countries (esp. the United States) do not opt in
* As emissions are reduced globally, the incentive to reduce goes away again - you would expect the value of a carbon credit to decrease over time as companies make up-front investments in more efficient/less emissive systems. [right? This is my analysis - wouldn't the government have to keep cutting and cutting the caps to make this work? I haven't seen anything about a long-term plan to this effect. Need to further research phases of Kyoto Protocol.] [Update: this is addressed– phases exist specifically to keep cutting the carbon cap]
* Alternative: tax carbon-based fuels at the point at which they exit the earth or cross a border. This creates a clear and predictable accounting. [Lovins, 226-227][Lovins]
