# Renewable energy
* NREL recognizes seven basic sources of renewable energy: biomass, hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, hydrogen, ocean [Bronin, 223][Bronin]
* Hoped-for breakthrough technologies: fusion reactors, nanoscale solar cells [Victor]
* New generation of power 2015-2040 is dominated by renewable and natural gas, regardless of policy. Policy drives the extent to which natural gas dominates. [EIA, 100][EIA]
* Solar & wind together are expected to dominate (80%) renewables capacity by 2040 [EIA, 114][EIA]
* The renewable energy market is highly sensitive to the price of oil and gas. If natural gas prices are low (they are), renewables grow about half as much as they would if oil & gas were expensive [EIA, 114][EIA]
* [EIA, 59][EIA] has a graph of what renewable energy sectors to watch depending on whether/how CPP gets implemented
* Learn more about municipal solid waste (MSW) for energy generation [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Municipal_solid_waste#Energy_generation) qualifies for RPS in some states [EIA, 38][EIA]

## On tribal lands
* Tribal lands are 5% of USA but have 10% of its energy resources (both renewable & nonrenewable) [Bronin, 224][Bronin]
* 95 million acres of tribal lands in the United States [Bronin, 221][Bronin]
* Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination Act (ITEDSA), passed in 2005 for energy infrastructure on reservations. Allows leasing for renewables construction w/o federal approval.  [Bronin, 222][Bronin]
* Tribal lands typically have fewer land use restrictions than nontribal [Bronin, 225][Bronin]
* As of 1990, energy availability at no cost was 10x higher on reservation lands than elsewhere in the United States. Of the 16k households in the US with no electricity access, 75% were in the Navajo Reservation. [Bronin, 228][Bronin]
