## Cleaner industrial processes
* Capturing carbon at its source is a good idea, but companies are not incentivized to capture and sequester their emissions. “CCS” (carbon capture and sequestration) involves sorting CO2 out of exhaust at its source, transporting the CO2 (typically, in compressed form through pipelines) and injecting it into underground structures [Smil, 89][Smil]

## Other
* In a 1995 survey published in the MIT Press, a substantial majority justified environmental protection by explicitly invoking God's name as creator. From the article, "It seems that divine creation is the closest concept American culture provides to express the sacredness of nature. Regardless of whether one actually believes in biblical Creation, it is the best vehicle we have to express this value." [Louv, 248][Louv]
* China's Grain to Green program (started 2000) gives subsidies to farmers who convert farmland  to forest or grassland [Diamond, 377][Diamond]
* Microgrids further reading: http://uconn.lawreviewnetwork.com/files/documents/SaraC.Bronin43Conn.L.Rev.547.pdf
* Ship transport accounts for 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions [Hawken, 140][Hawken]
* Shipping vessels are efficiency-regulated by the EEDI [Hawken, 140][Hawken]
* Recycling reduces resource extraction, minimizes pollutants, and can decrease energy use. For example, recycled aluminum (one of the most efficient to recycle) uses 95% less energy than from virgin materials [Hawken, 159][Hawken]
* Recycled materials have two sources of values: as commodity (raw materials) and as sinks (value of not incurring the economic, social, and ecological costs of otherwise disposing of the waste) [Hawken, 159][Hawken]
* Recycling is measured as recycling rate, which varies widely by location [Hawken, 159][Hawken]
* Where recycling is not government-supported, microenterprises can commoditize the waste and provide by-household service, e.g. WeCycle (using cargo bikes to pick up) in Nigeria [Hawken, 159][Hawken]
* In high-income cities, factors for successful recycling policies include public awareness while making collection easy and using incentives such as pay-as-you-throw (San Francisco) [Hawken, 159][Hawken]
* EPR, policy to improve thoughtful lifecycle design of products, includes charges to a company for the cost of recovery and recycling (pure financial approach) or can include company recovery and reprocessing of the product [Hawken, 160][Hawken]
* U. S. Materials Marketplace is a matchmaking market for secondary-use materials [Hawken, 161][Hawken]
