# Energy efficiency
* NAS reports show that it's much cheaper to make current systems more efficient than it is to create new energy sources [Lovins, 31][Lovins]
* Key targets for energy efficiency gains: transportation, buildings, agriculture, forestry [Lovins, 32][Lovins]
* Distributed generation is similar in metric to efficiency gains– both increased efficiency and the practice of producing power locally reduce draw on electric grid delivered energy [EIA, 102][EIA]

## Ground transportation
* Several states have policies in place requiring domestic manufacturers to produce a specific percentage of ZEV's and TZEV's in the coming years. The targets look aggressive, but the effect is likely not so big since we import a lot of our passenger vehicles [EIA, 22][EIA]
* Long-haul truckers often leave diesel engines in during mandatory 10h rest periods to power "hotel load". Better if they use Auxiliary Power Units and switch off the engine. [Lovins, 138][Lovins]

## Commercial buildings
* Efficiency in lighting is expected to improve 70% over the 2015-2040 period as buildings (commercial, industrial, residential) switch to LED and other efficient light sources [EIA, 103][EIA]
* Total energy delivered to commercial buildings is expected to decrease over 2015-2040 despite growth of commercial floorspace. This is driven by increased efficiency, specifically in lighting, heating, cooling, and ventilation, as well as more efficient building codes [EIA, 102][EIA]
* Commercial buildings are expected to reduce energy costs by adopting natural gas-powered microturbines, which allow for CHP [EIA, 102][EIA]

## Industrial
* Industrial sector energy consumption is expected to increase through 2040, partly driven by the sector's high use of natural gas (and NG's low cost) [EIA, 23][EIA]

## Residential buildings
* Distributed generation is expected to increase substantially, heavily dependent on extension of subsidization policies in the period 2015-2040 [EIA, 102][EIA]
* Lighting, heating, cooling, and ventilation are expected to be the biggest efficiency gains in the residential sector through 2040 [EIA, 101][EIA]

## Marine
* Shipping annual fuel costs can be reduced 10-35% through a skysail: effectively a kite (higher air currents) that can be used to pull ships [Lovins, 143][Lovins]
