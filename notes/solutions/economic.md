# Economic approach

## Capitalism
* Using less energy/using renewables can save companies money - Walmart is a leading example [Lovins, 12][Lovins]
* Companies required to disclose accounting information including carbon footprint under the [Sarbanes-Oxley Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarbanes–Oxley_Act). This lets the public see economic effect of cutting emissions; the trend has been cost savings [Lovins, 11][Lovins]
* Major $ savings to be had in more efficient buildings; 76% of energy produced in USA goes to building operation [Lovins, 15][Lovins]
* Biggest blocker to companies that would like to go greener (more efficient/renewable): up-front capital [Lovins, 31][Lovins]
* Utilities: some are publicly owned; some are from private investment. Particularly those with private investment stand to gain from clients using more energy. In the 1970s they even sold in declining block rates. PUC for each state sets rates, some use inverted rates and some decouple energy quantity from $ paid to utility company. Some reward utility companies for reducing client consumption (ex. Batinovich Plan) [Lovins, 47-48][Lovins]

## Job creation
* Renewable energy creates more jobs per unit of energy delivered than fossil fuels [Klein, 116][Klein]
* Comprehensive policies to reduce emissions in the transport sector by 80% would create 7 million new jobs across Europe according to European Transport Workers Federation (2011) [Klein, 116][Klein]
* Cutting electricity emissions by 90% across Europe would create 5 million clean energy jobs [Klein, 116][Klein]
* Public transit investments create 31% more jobs than investment in road & bridge construction [Klein, 116][Klein]
