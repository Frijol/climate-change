# Geoengineering
* Geoengineering: "the deliberate large-scale intervention in the Earth's climate system, in order to moderate global warming" (Royal society paper, in [Goodell, 16][Goodell])
* Two main approaches to geoengineering: carbon engineering & engineering of the earth's albedo [Goodell, 17][Goodell]
* Main promise of geoengineering: delay inevitable catastrophic warming of the earth. It's a desperate measure, but it seems likely that we'll have to use it at some point [Goodell, 115][Goodell]
* Three main arguments against geoengineering: (1) we don't understand the system we're messing with and we'd be likely to mess it up in a really catastrophic way. (2) geoengineering distracts from the main problem, which is that we're still emitting too many greenhouse gases and need to figure out how to stop doing that. (3) Western civilization in the modern era is unsustainable regardless of the planet's temperature, and we'd end up depleting even more resources on the industry of planetary cooling [Goodell, 18-21][Goodell]

## Carbon sequestration
* Carbon sequestration is not something we can reliably accomplish in an energy-efficient manner with clear and permanent results. Many otherwise valuable carbon sequestration opportunities are decreasingly powerful due to the effects of global warming. [Smil]
* Pumping CO2 into basalt might have a small effect, but it’s unproven. The idea is to trap CO2 in basalt layers beneath the Indian Ocean and/or the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate. This method, if functional, could only trap 4% of American CO2 emissions — so, this would be less effective than raising car emissions standards [Smil, 87][Smil]
* We don’t have an infrastructure to capture, move, and sequester carbon. Most sequestration solutions depend on pipelines of CO2 and other infrastructure that we don’t have and which will take time to build [Smil, 87][Smil]

### Sequestration in forests
* Sequestering the amount of carbon we emit in trees would require truly enormous new forests. Planting mixed forests sequesters carbon at the rate over which the trees mature — so in 10–80 years after planting (depending on the type of tree), the tree must continue to live to hold carbon, but it does not offset new emissions [Smil, 82][Smil]. Offsetting just 10% of 2005 carbon would require a planting as big as the combined forests of North America and Russia, or a ~15% increase in tropical forests [Smil, 82][Smil].

### Sequestration in soil
* There is opportunity to sequester carbon in soil, but global warming makes this type of sequestration uncertain in the long term. Soil stores about 4 times the carbon that is stored in land plants [Smil, 83][Smil]. Tropospheric ozone levels are increasing and can reduce plant productivity thus slowing soil sequestration. Uncertainty caused by global warming means we can’t know whether soil will net store carbon from plants or net emit it from decomposition [Smil, 83][Smil]
* Biochar could improve carbon sequestration in soil, but there are logistical and environmental challenges. Soil with biochar stores 2.5x carbon as soil of the same type without it [Smil, 83][Smil]. However, there is currently no supply chain set up to source waste biomass [Smil, 84][Smil].
* Biochar can provide only a small piece of the solution; 900 million tons of straw (the total amount produced by affluent counties) turned into biochar (ignoring the logistical and application challenges) would sequester only 2.5% of the CO2 emitted globally in 2005 [Smil, 84][Smil].

## Albedo engineering
* Albedo engineering to change reflectivity of the earth- painting roofs and roads white, injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere [Goodell, 17][Goodell]
* With albedo engineering, blocking 2% of Earth's sunlight returns climate to preindustrial levels - though this doesn't fix the other problems high CO2 causes [Goodell, 17][Goodell]
* Surest way to have a quick impact and stop Arctic ice from melting is albedo engineering, which is either brightening clouds or filling the stratosphere with particles. Either of these could in theory cool the Arctic quickly enough to immediately stop ice melt. [Goodell, 114][Goodell]
* Computer models suggest that albedo engineering will cause massive droughts, particularly in Africa and Asia. These were seen when Mt. Pinatubo erupted, and they would be worse over time. There is every likelihood that the albedo engineering approach would create problems beyond those immediately caused by global warming. [Klein, 248][Klein]
* Planting trees in previously unforested areas in an attempt to offset carbon is controversial because of the change in albedo - it's unclear whether it is a net positive or negative. [Lovins, 239][Lovins]

### Particles injected into the stratosphere
* We know for sure that particles in the atmosphere can cool the planet by a degree or two because that has happened with some big volcanoes in the past.
* How do you inject the stratosphere with particles? Teller & Wood looked into this problem: for $1 billion/year, set off an artificial volcano every 5-6 years full of particles 1/10th of a micron in diameter made of some nonreactive metallic substance [Goodell, 123][Goodell]
* Testing the stratospheric albedo approach: over 70 deg latitude, shade 20% to stop melting; 50% to grow the ice. The particles would rain out in a year or so. (Caldeira) [Goodell, 127][Goodell]
* Particles in the stratosphere might trigger the creation of chlorine, which degrades the ozone [Goodell, 131][Goodell]
* Particles in the stratosphere might affect monsoons and destroy agriculture [Goodell, 132][Goodell]
* If we stopped putting particles in the air, the heat would come back right away [Goodell, 133][Goodell]

### Cloud brightening
* Smaller particles are more reflective than bigger particles of the same substance. Making the water droplets smaller could make them brighter [Goodell, 169][Goodell]
* Spraying atomized salt water from the ocean into the air could make the moisture in clouds form around the salt, which would be smaller particules than their current form [Goodell, 169][Goodell]
* According to Latham, 50-70% of the world's ocean-covering clouds would have to be brightened in order to offset a doubling of CO2 [Goodell, 182][Goodell]
* This could impact global weather patterns, esp. rainfall [Goodell, 184][Goodell]

## Carbon engineering
* Carbon engineering is less controversial than albedo engineering, more similar to Earth's natural carbon cycle. E.g. air scrubbers, iron in the ocean to create plankton blooms, huge plantations of trees [Goodell, 17][Goodell]
* Plankton blooms: if we dump several tons of iron into the ocean, we can cause a phytoplankton bloom. Phytoplankton are 1% of photosynthetic material but take in 50% of the carbon on Earth, then sink to the bottom of the ocean when they die (trapping carbon for centuries-millennia) [Goodell, 137][Goodell]
* Not sure what would eat the phytoplankton, and not sure what changing the nutritional balance of the ocean would do to other life forms [Goodell, 137][Goodell]
* Carbon-sucking machines: "There's no way you can do a useful amount of carbon dioxide removal in less than a third of a century or maybe half a century." -David Keith, geoengineer & creator of a carbon-sucking machine [Klein, 229][Klein]
