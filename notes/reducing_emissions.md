# Reducing Harmful Emissions

## Energy efficiency
* NAS reports show that it's much cheaper to make current systems more efficient than it is to create new energy sources [Lovins, 31][Lovins]
* Key targets for energy efficiency gains: transportation, buildings, agriculture, forestry [Lovins, 32][Lovins]
* Long-haul truckers often leave diesel engines in during mandatory 10h rest periods to power "hotel load". Better if they use Auxiliary Power Units and switch off the engine. [Lovins, 138][Lovins]
* Shipping annual fuel costs can be reduced 10-35% through a skysail: effectively a kite (higher air currents) that can be used to pull ships [Lovins, 143][Lovins]

## Cleaner industrial processes
* Capturing carbon at its source is a good idea, but companies are not incentivized to capture and sequester their emissions. “CCS” (carbon capture and sequestration) involves sorting CO2 out of exhaust at its source, transporting the CO2 (typically, in compressed form through pipelines) and injecting it into underground structures [Smil, 89][Smil]
