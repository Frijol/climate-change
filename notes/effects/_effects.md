# Effects of climate change

## Weather extremes
* On average, storms last 60% longer and have wind speeds 15% higher in the 2000s than they did in the 1950s [Pearce, 215][Pearce]

## Glacier retreat
* In Glacier Bay (AK), ice front surveyed by Cook in late 1700s retreated 50 miles by 1980s [Montgomery, 32][Montgomery]
* Glacier National Park in the late 1800s had over 150 glaciers, 35 in 2005, at current rates 0 by 2030 [Diamond, 37][Diamond]
* As of May 2014, glacier melt in a section of West Antarctica (~the size of France) "appears unstoppable"[Klein, 16][Klein]

## Drought
* The percentage of Earth's land area stricken by serious drought has more than doubled in 30 years. In the 1970s, it was less than 15% of the land; by the early 2000s, it was more than 30% [Pearce, 173][Pearce]
* There is a correlation between droughts in the western United States, South America, parts of Europe, and Central Asia [Pearce, 173][Pearce]
* Droughts affect 30% of China's cropland every year [Diamond, 367][Diamond]
* China is short on water, especially in the north. Water supply in the north is 1/5 per capita that it is in the south; shortages occasionally halt industrial production. 2/3 of city + irrigation water is from groundwater aquifers, which are beginning to salinate in coastal areas and collapse in emptier inland ones [Diamond, 365][Diamond]

### Desertification
* Desertification: forces massive migration of villages (and cities) [Larsson]
* In order to stop desertification, you need to make something that will catch sand and keep it from blowing past its borders and taking in more land. E.g. wall of trees [Larsson]
* Around the Sahara, people are often poor and will chop down trees planted as sandbreak for firewood. Larsson proposes sandbreak made of sandstone, hardened by some bugs [Larsson]

## Flooding
* If the West Antarctic ice sheet disintegrates (could take centuries), the sea level will rise 3-5m [Klein, 16][Klein]
* Major cities that will likely disappear under a rising ocean: Boston, New York, Los Angeles, Vancouver, London, Mumbai, Hong Kong, Shanghai [Klein, 14][Klein]
* Wet places will get wetter; drought-stricken places will get drier as the course of global warming continues. The air will be overall more humid. [Pearce, 174][Pearce]
