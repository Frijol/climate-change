## OPEC and oil dependence
* "In 2006, members of the OPEC oil cartel earned $506 billion from oil exports. In 2007, OPEC income rose to roughly $535 billion, and it was expected to surge to over $600 billion in 2008." [Friedman, 79][Friedman]
* Friedman's "First Law of Petropolitics": As the price of oil goes up, the pace of freedom goes down; and as the price of oil goes down, the pace of freedom goes up [Friedman, 81][Friedman]
* OPEC drove rise in oil prices less than $2/barrel 1973 to more than $11/barrel in 1974, not in response to supply shortage [Smil, 1][Smil]
* US dependence on foreign oil has been increasing fairly steadily from 37% of oil around 1973 to 63% in 2007 [Smil, 135][Smil]
* [Pickens Plan](http://www.pickensplan.com/the-plan/) is an effort to transition the United States off of foreign oil dependence
