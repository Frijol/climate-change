# Climate Change

Personal notes as I explore the subject of climate change.

## Why research this?

There are a lot of problems with the world. A lot of the major issues (war, human displacement, destruction of natural spaces, etc.) lead back fairly directly to issues with energy.

Climate change is one of the symptoms of the issues surrounding human use of energy. But it's also the issue which has most directly driven research towards energy solutions.

I want to learn more about the crisis which is most likely to kill humanity on a short time scale, get a sense of how this will occur, and see what solutions have been explored in this space.

## How do I use this book?

If you're in the Gitbook, you can hover over or click on links. Underlined links are glossary terms (hover or click to read descriptions); non-underlined links are citations - hover to read bibliography or click to access articles or links to books.

## How is this organized?

Main sections have an introduction to what is there; they will also have a "stubs" section for unsorted notes and pieces which don't yet deserve their own sections.

Glossary section includes some pieces which are not necessarily mentioned in the notes. They should serve as an introduction to the key terms and description of processes in the space.

Bibliography section is annotated with a basic description per source, but I haven't yet found a good way to have it display in the gitbook. Work in progress.

Areas of opportunity is a great place to start if you're looking for ways an engineer might work in this space or what some key questions might be.

## Meta-notes: what is here, and what is missing?

### Overall comments

- In general, this book is full of weird levels of specificity. The aim: provide broad context and increasing detail in promising areas. This doesn't always play out & can be corrected
- Much of this is US-centric. Haven't decided if this is as it should be or not– climate change is global, but if the intent is to provide actionable and timely notes, focus on just one area is likely appropriate/international examples are good where adaptable/usable as prior art

### Specific area assessments

#### Energy

- Biofuel is fairly complete as a basic intro to the issue for non-chemists. Not much there for "where do we go next?"
- Coal is good but very US-centric
- Geothermal is very basic, could use filling out. Also, do I have notes on "fake geothermal" e.g. server farm heat harvesting?
- Infrastructure is already long but could use some work. Will likely only make sense as case studies. There is currently a decent level of case study into CA DER policy but not much about overarching trends
- Natural gas is pretty good, link to my Medium post on the topic?

#### Solutions

- The notes on Cap and Trade notes are currently in solutions/policy but belong in solutions/economic (policy is only one possible implementation of an inherently economics-based solution)
