Gaps in my information– rough to-learn list.

* What's the price per barrel of shale oil (traditionally mined & in situ heated)? http://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/051215/cost-shale-oil-versus-conventional-oil.asp
* What's the breakdown on how oil is used, by percent? https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=oil_use and http://www.sankey-diagrams.com/tag/oil/
* What are the major positives to the use of oil?
* What does the oil processing pipeline look like, overall? http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/oil-drilling.htm
* What is the existing infrastructure support for oil? (Pipeline map at https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/maps-of-american-infrastrucure/)
* Tar sands, substantially different from shale oil?
* What is the trend in oil consumption? Is it useful to make projections based on current oil consumption, or is that quantity rising?
* When did oil take over from coal?
* Coal basics– read a book. What's the mechanism? Where does it come from? Why don't we use it as much, and who does?
* For tidal, what terrain characteristics are necessary?
* What is the exact argument for characterizing tidal as useful vs. not useful globally?
* Why does it make sense that geographic restriction would drive larger tidal differences rather than smaller ones?
* What is a straflo turbine?
* What is a bulb turbine?
* What is a hydrofoil?
* What is a helicoidal turbine?
* Define brownout
* What is the term for when the electrical supply is too high?
* What does the grid do to dump power when oversupplied?
* What is the uptime on the American electrical grid? What about compared to other countries?
* What are ballpark stats on number of electrical generation facilities hooked into the grid, and points of demand?
