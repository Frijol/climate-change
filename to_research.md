# To Research

Gaps in my information– rough to-learn list.

* What's the price per barrel of shale oil (traditionally mined & in situ heated)?
* What's the breakdown on how oil is used, by percent?
* What are the major positives to the use of oil?
* What does the oil processing pipeline look like, overall?
* What is the existing infrastructure support for oil?
* Tar sands, substantially different from shale oil?
* What is the trend in oil consumption? Is it useful to make projections based on current oil consumption, or is that quantity rising?
* When did oil take over from coal?
* Coal basics– read a book. What's the mechanism? Where does it come from? Why don't we use it as much, and who does?
* For tidal, what terrain characteristics are necessary?
* What is the exact argument for characterizing tidal as useful vs. not useful globally?
* Why does it make sense that geographic restriction would drive larger tidal differences rather than smaller ones?
* How is EGS different from regular geothermal?
