## Successes
* Klein's analysis on successful movements for the environment in the last several years: Blockadia (civil disobedience), fossil fuel divestment/reinvestment movement,local laws against high-risk extraction, court challenges by Indigenous groups. [Klein, 407][Klein]

## Questions/blog post ideas
* How are utility companies incentivized/disincentivized re energy use reductions?
* Pros/cons: nuclear power
* How much would oil have to cost for X alternative biofuel to make sense - esp waste products like polystyrene, coffee grounds, human fat etc
* How to create sustainable reasonably priced alternative to personal car ownership for disabled? Electric Uber with self driving much cheaper?
* What industries use diesel/wouldn't need retrofit to switch to biofuel?
* Consumption of diesel vs production of biofuel over time
* How exactly does the carbon cycle work and how can we manipulate it
* What is the carbon "exchange rate" of not driving cars vs. planting trees vs. etc.? Planting 8777 trees = taking 9.33 cars off the road = 111940 roads removed [Lovins, 71][Lovins]
* What $ savings/investments can be made for various energy efficiency improvements?
* How does ethanol vs. oil-based fuel work?
* Original car inventors envisioned ethanol as the primary fuel for the vehicle. Why did we make the switch?
* Blockadia phrased as a war, with death/injury counts of protestors and police
* SequoiaView for utilities usage - ability to drill down to see who is using how much of what
* How to eat to minimize carbon footprint - partially resolved, see [Berners-Lee][Berners-Lee] and [my post on it](https://blog.hc3.io/book-report-how-bad-are-bananas-the-carbon-footprint-of-everything-d254377af813#.c97uah753)
* How power is lost in the grid system and ideas to combat this
* Create accurate public perception surrounding the social and planetary costs of nuclear energy. Waste disposal and other issues are not all worked out, ethically – but where do these impacts stand in relation to coal and oil in terms of human and environmental degradation per watt?

## Engineering/wild ideas
* Electric car batteries when not in use as a distributed power storage network for a city/community [Lovins, 94][Lovins]
* Building efficiency is a big waste of energy, people would fix their own if they knew how much. How can we make thermal scans/cameras more accessible such that people can scan for energy loss easily?
* Anti-smoking campaign was comprised of top-down (science, regulation) + bottom up (knowledge about secondhand smoke leading to community action). Can a similar approach be applied to climate change action? [Louv, 254][Louv]
* Electric cars pull a lot of load; how do we manage the charging of each electric car so that we don’t create a new energy peak?
* Gas-fueled internal combustion engines might be a more efficient way to get energy into a car for some time to come. American energy is largely oil-produced; the tradeoff of miles per gallon of gas directly in the car vs. through an electricity generation process and transport through the grid is comparable– about 38mpg for an average electric car in 2008 (p27). With this in mind, one challenge is to improve the efficiency of the gas-powered combustion engine. Such projects are underway, e.g. DiesOtto by Mercedes-Benz. [Smil, 28][Smil]
* What’s a better energy storage solution than Lithium-ion batteries?
* Reduce the power consumption of an electric car, or increase the ramp-up speed of bringing additional (sustainable) power online to bring about mass adoption of electric cars
* A big reason why new nuclear plants have been expensive is that the laws changed while construction was already underway. Another (relatedly) is that they don’t follow a standard design. There may be an opportunity to greatly reduce construction cost and time by designing and implementing a standardized nuclear plant now that regulations are more settled.
* Devise a good/safe/reliable method for storing a small volume of highly radioactive waste to be sequestered for thousands of years. No country has one yet. [Smil, 43][Smil]


## Entrepreneurship
* Training construction workers in how to build cheaper, more efficient sites using green techniques (many only know one way of building a given thing/now a little out of date) - can reduce cost to build, give the construction sites [Lovins]
* Leveraging higher numbers of HVDC lines in China to transport renewable power efficiently? ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/HVDC-Lines-in-US-and-China-800x522.jpg) [Naam][NaamWind]
* A way to let consumers choose their own power source. This already exists but the consumer motive is lacking (it's extra effort and often extra expense, for nothing better than "you feel good about it"). ID a way to make end customers intrinsically motivated to choose cleaner power sources?
* A way to break out energy usage by type on the electrical bill [Friedman]
* Funding/help from emerging technology departments at utility companies
* Ways to help balance peak loads: colocation of wind + solar, Nest-style smart appliances that seek energy when it's cheapest to generate, others?
* Preventative maintenance ideas: monitor to know when parts are likely to malfunction, make parts that are easier to maintain (e.g. more washable solar plants)
* "Smart grid" space - greater efficiency through greater knowledge of how the electricity is used, potentially in conjunction with smart appliances
* Ways to manufacture and transport large wind turbine components (see ![](http://rameznaam.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Wind-Tower-Optimal-Size-vs-Transportable-Size-800x566.jpg) [Naam][NaamWind]) GE is working on this: https://www.gerenewableenergy.com/wind-energy/technology/space-frame-tower.html
* What are the main causes behind slow hybrid adoption– do they apply to electrics, and are these things we can change? Primary blocker = cost to write off existing investments. Can we grow the market of leased vehicles (at least in some niche)?
* Soil is typically replenished from volcanic ash, glacier retreat, and uplift of crust. The places where this doesn't happen (notably Australia) have very low arable land. [Diamond, 381][Diamond] Target these places first for biochar tillage? Possible to synthesize biochar from waste products e.g. compost in these areas? Challenges – currently uneconomical for Australia to *have* agriculture as a significant factor in its economy, cheaper to import basically everything. What levers to make local food desirable? Nationalism/tariffs? What are the economics of biochar importation, or are there local undesirable biomass sources? Non-native species such as mimosa and rubber vine (both of which grow crazy fast), combined with high local knowledge of how to do mass vegetation removal? (Also non-native animal species such as rabbits and foxes, but might not work out for positive ROI)
* Find a way to make kangaroo meat a profitable export of Australia by playing up its exoticism overseas? Probably a waste of time, as local food would be a preferable solution to reduce shipping impacts
